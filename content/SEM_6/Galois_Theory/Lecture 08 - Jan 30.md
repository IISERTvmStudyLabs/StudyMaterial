## Algebraic Closure

Let $K$ be a field.

An **algebraic closure** of $K$ is a field $\overline{K}$ such that:

1. 
$$
K \subset \overline{K},
$$

2. 
$$
\overline{K}/K \text{ is algebraic},
$$

3. Every non-constant polynomial over $K$ has a root in $\overline{K}$.

## Algebraically Closed Field

A field $K$ is called **algebraically closed** if every non-constant polynomial over $K$ has a root in $K$.

### Observation

If $K$ is algebraically closed, then

$$
\overline{K} = K.
$$

---

## Proposition

Let $K \subset \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is algebraically closed.

Define

$$
K^{\text{alg}} = \{ \alpha \in \Omega \mid \alpha \text{ is algebraic over } K \}.
$$

Then

$$
K^{\text{alg}} = \overline{K}.
$$

### Proof Sketch

- If $\alpha, \beta$ are algebraic over $K$, then
  $$
  \alpha \pm \beta, \quad \alpha\beta, \quad \alpha^{-1}
  $$
  are algebraic over $K$, so $K^{\text{alg}}$ is a field.

- Clearly,
  $$
  K \subset K^{\text{alg}},
  $$
  so it is an algebraic extension of $K$.

- Let $f(x) \in K[x]$ be non-constant.
  Since $\Omega$ is algebraically closed, $f$ has a root $\alpha \in \Omega$.

  Because $\alpha$ satisfies a polynomial in $K[x]$, it is algebraic over $K$, hence

  $$
  \alpha \in K^{\text{alg}}.
  $$

Thus every polynomial over $K$ has a root in $K^{\text{alg}}$, so

$$
K^{\text{alg}} = \overline{K}.
$$

## Proposition

Let $K$ be a field and $\overline{K}$ its algebraic closure.

Then $\overline{K}$ is algebraically closed.

### Proof Sketch

Let

$$
f(x) \in \overline{K}[x]
$$

be a non-constant polynomial.

Let $\alpha$ be a root of $f(x)$ in some extension field of $\overline{K}$.

Then:

- $\alpha$ is algebraic over $\overline{K}$.
- Since $\overline{K}/K$ is algebraic, $\alpha$ is algebraic over $K$.
- Let $m_{\alpha,K}(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $K$.

Because $\overline{K}$ contains all roots of polynomials over $K$,

$$
\alpha \in \overline{K}.
$$

Hence every polynomial over $\overline{K}$ has a root in $\overline{K}$, so it is algebraically closed.

## Polynomial Rings in Many Variables

Let $\Lambda$ be a set.

Define

$$
K[\Lambda]
$$

to be the polynomial ring in variables indexed by $\Lambda$.

An element $f \in K[\Lambda]$ if there exists a finite subset

$$
\{x_1, \dots, x_n\} \subset \Lambda
$$

such that

$$
f = f(x_1, \dots, x_n).
$$

Equivalently,

$$
K[\Lambda]
=
\bigcup_{I \subset \Lambda,\; I \text{ finite}} K[I].
$$

## Theorem: Existence of Algebraic Closure

Let $K$ be a field.

Then an algebraic closure $\overline{K}$ exists.

### Proof Idea

We construct a field containing $K$ in which every polynomial over $K$ has a root.

1. Let
   $$
   \Lambda = \{ f \mid f \in K[x],\; f \text{ non-constant} \}.
   $$

2. Consider the polynomial ring
   $$
   K[\Lambda],
   $$
   where each $f \in \Lambda$ corresponds to a variable $x_f$.

3. For each $f \in \Lambda$, consider the polynomial
   $$
   f(x_f) \in K[\Lambda].
   $$

4. Let $I$ be the ideal generated by all these elements:
   $$
   I = \langle f(x_f) \mid f \in \Lambda \rangle.
   $$

5. One checks that $I$ is a proper ideal.

6. Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal containing $I$.

7. Define
   $$
   L = K[\Lambda]/\mathfrak{m}.
   $$

Then:

- $L$ is a field,
- $K \subset L$,
- every polynomial over $K$ has a root in $L$.

Finally, take the algebraic elements over $K$ inside $L$ to obtain $\overline{K}$.
