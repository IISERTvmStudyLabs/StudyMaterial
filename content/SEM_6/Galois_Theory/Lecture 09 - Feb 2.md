## Recap: Existence of Algebraic Closure

### Theorem

For every field $K$, an algebraic closure $\overline{K}$ exists.

---

## Proof (Construction)

Let

$$
\Lambda = \{ f \mid f \in K[x],\ f \text{ non-constant} \}.
$$

Consider the polynomial ring

$$
K[\Lambda],
$$

with one variable $x_f$ for each $f \in \Lambda$.

For each $f \in \Lambda$, consider the polynomial

$$
f(x_f) \in K[\Lambda].
$$

Let

$$
I = \langle f(x_f) \mid f \in \Lambda \rangle
\subset K[\Lambda]
$$

be the ideal generated by these elements.

---

### Claim

$$
I \neq K[\Lambda].
$$

If $I = K[\Lambda]$, then $1 \in I$.

So there exist finitely many polynomials $f_1, \dots, f_m \in \Lambda$ and elements $g_i \in K[\Lambda]$ such that

$$
1 = \sum_{i=1}^m g_i \, f_i(x_{f_i}).
$$

Each $g_i$ involves only finitely many variables, so the above equality involves only finitely many variables.

Now suppose $K'$ is a field extension of $K$ containing a root $\alpha_i$ of each $f_i$.

Substituting $x_{f_i} = \alpha_i$, we get

$$
1 = \sum g_i(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m)\, f_i(\alpha_i) = 0,
$$

a contradiction.

Hence $I$ is a proper ideal.

---

### Constructing a Field

Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $K[\Lambda]$ containing $I$.

Define

$$
L = K[\Lambda]/\mathfrak{m}.
$$

Then $L$ is a field containing $K$.

Moreover, for each $f \in K[x]$, the image of $x_f$ in $L$ is a root of $f$.

Thus $L$ contains a root of every non-constant polynomial in $K[x]$.

---

### Making it Algebraically Closed

If $L$ is already algebraically closed, we are done.

If not, repeat the process: adjoin roots of polynomials over $L$.

If this does not terminate in finitely many steps, take the union

$$
\Omega = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} L_i,
$$

where each $L_{i+1}$ is obtained from $L_i$ by adjoining roots of all polynomials over $L_i$.

---

### Why $\Omega$ is Algebraically Closed

Let $f(x) \in \Omega[x]$.

Its coefficients lie in some $L_N$.

By construction, $f$ has a root in $L_{N+1} \subset \Omega$.

Hence $\Omega$ is algebraically closed.

---

## Extension of Homomorphisms

### Theorem

Let $L/K$ be an algebraic extension, and let $\Omega$ be an algebraically closed field.

Let

$$
\sigma : K \to \Omega
$$

be a field homomorphism.

Then $\sigma$ extends to a field homomorphism

$$
\widetilde{\sigma} : L \to \Omega
$$

such that

$$
\widetilde{\sigma}|_K = \sigma.
$$

---

## Proof

### Step 1: Simple Extension

Assume

$$
L = K(\alpha).
$$

Define

$$
\sigma_0 : K[x] \to \Omega[x]
$$

by applying $\sigma$ to coefficients:

$$
f(x) \mapsto f^\sigma(x).
$$

Let $m_{\alpha,K}(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $K$.

Then

$$
m_{\alpha,K}^\sigma(x) \in \Omega[x].
$$

Since $\Omega$ is algebraically closed, there exists $\beta \in \Omega$ such that

$$
m_{\alpha,K}^\sigma(\beta) = 0.
$$

Define

$$
\widetilde{\sigma}(\alpha) = \beta.
$$

This determines a homomorphism

$$
\widetilde{\sigma} : K(\alpha) \to \Omega.
$$

---

### Step 2: General Case (Zorn's Lemma)

Let

$$
\Sigma = \{ (M,\phi) \mid K \subset M \subset L,\ \phi : M \to \Omega,\ \phi|_K = \sigma \}.
$$

Define a partial order:

$$
(M_1,\phi_1) \le (M_2,\phi_2)
\quad \text{if} \quad
M_1 \subset M_2
\text{ and }
\phi_2|_{M_1} = \phi_1.
$$

Then $\Sigma$ is nonempty (contains $(K,\sigma)$).

By Zorn's Lemma, there exists a maximal element $(M,\phi)$.

If $M \neq L$, then there exists $\alpha \in L \setminus M$.

Since $L/K$ is algebraic, $\alpha$ is algebraic over $M$.

By Step 1, $\phi$ extends to $M(\alpha)$, contradicting maximality.

Hence

$$
M = L.
$$

Therefore, $\phi$ extends to all of $L$.

---

### Conclusion

Every field homomorphism

$$
\sigma : K \to \Omega
$$

extends to a homomorphism

$$
\widetilde{\sigma} : L \to \Omega
$$

when $L/K$ is algebraic and $\Omega$ is algebraically closed.
