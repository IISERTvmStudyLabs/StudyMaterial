### Recap

- Algebraic closure exists.
- If $L/K$ is finite, then
  $$
  |\operatorname{Aut}(L/K)| < \infty,
  \qquad
  |\operatorname{Aut}(L/K)| \le [L:K].
  $$
- If $K$ is a field and $G \subset \operatorname{Aut}(K)$ is finite, then
  $$
  |G| = [K : K^G].
  $$

## Proposition

If $L/K$ is an algebraic extension, then any $K$-algebra homomorphism

$$
\sigma : L \to L
$$

is surjective.

### Proof

Let $\alpha \in L$. We claim that $\alpha \in \sigma(L)$.

Since $\alpha$ is algebraic over $K$, it satisfies some polynomial over $K$.  
Let

$$
m_{\alpha,K}(x)
$$

be its minimal polynomial.

Let $E$ be the subfield of $L$ containing all roots of $m_{\alpha,K}$ that lie in $L$.

We have

$$
\sigma : L \to L
\quad\text{and}\quad
\sigma(E) \subset E,
$$

because if $\alpha$ is a root of $m_{\alpha,K}$, then $\sigma(\alpha)$ is also a root of the same polynomial.

Hence $\sigma(E) \subset E$.

Since

$$
[E:K] = [\sigma(E):K],
$$

we get

$$
\sigma(E) = E.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\alpha \in E = \sigma(E) \subset \sigma(L).
$$

Thus $\sigma$ is surjective.

## Normal Extension

Let $L/K$ be an algebraic extension and let $\overline{K}$ be an algebraic closure of $K$ containing $L$.

If for every $K$-algebra homomorphism

$$
\sigma : L \to \overline{K}
$$

we have

$$
\sigma(L) = L,
$$

then $L/K$ is called a **normal extension**.

---

### Example

Let

$$
K = \mathbb{Q}, \qquad L = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega),
$$

where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

Then $L/K$ is normal, since it contains all roots of

$$
x^3 - 2
\quad\text{and}\quad
x^2 + x + 1.
$$

---

If instead

$$
L' = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}),
$$

then $L'/K$ is not normal, because a $K$-embedding may send

$$
\sqrt[3]{2} \mapsto \omega \sqrt[3]{2},
$$

and

$$
\sigma(L') \ne L'.
$$

## Theorem

Let $L/K$ be an algebraic extension and let $\overline{K}$ be an algebraic closure containing $L$.

Then the following are equivalent:

1. $L/K$ is normal.
2. $L$ is the splitting field of some family of polynomials in $K[x]$.
3. If an irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in K[x]$ has one root in $L$, then it splits completely in $L$.

---

### Proof

#### (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2)

Since $L/K$ is algebraic, each $\alpha \in L$ is algebraic over $K$.

Let

$$
m_{\alpha,K}(x)
$$

be its minimal polynomial.

Let

$$
\mathcal{F} = \{ m_{\alpha,K}(x) \mid \alpha \in L \}.
$$

Take a $K$-embedding

$$
\tau : K(\alpha) \to \overline{K}.
$$

Since $L/K$ is algebraic, $\tau$ extends to

$$
\widetilde{\tau} : L \to \overline{K}.
$$

Because $L/K$ is normal,

$$
\widetilde{\tau}(L) = L.
$$

Thus every conjugate of $\alpha$ over $K$ lies in $L$.

Hence $m_{\alpha,K}$ splits in $L$.

Therefore $L$ is the splitting field of $\mathcal{F}$.

---

#### (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1)

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of polynomials over $K$ such that $L$ is their splitting field.

Let

$$
\sigma : L \to \overline{K}
$$

be any $K$-algebra homomorphism.

If $\alpha$ is a root of some $f \in \mathcal{F}$, then $\sigma(\alpha)$ is also a root of $f$.

Since $L$ contains all roots of every $f \in \mathcal{F}$, we get

$$
\sigma(\alpha) \in L.
$$

Since $L$ is generated by these roots,

$$
\sigma(L) \subset L.
$$

Because $L/K$ is algebraic, $\sigma$ is surjective (by the previous proposition), hence

$$
\sigma(L) = L.
$$

Thus $L/K$ is normal.

---

#### (2) $\Leftrightarrow$ (3)

If $L$ is a splitting field, then any irreducible polynomial having one root in $L$ must split completely in $L$.

Conversely, if every irreducible polynomial over $K$ that has a root in $L$ splits in $L$, then $L$ is generated by roots of such polynomials and hence is a splitting field.

---

Therefore,

$$
L/K \text{ is normal}.
$$
