## Adjoining Elements

Let $L/K$ be a field extension and $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n \in L$.

- The smallest **subring** of $L$ containing $K$ and $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ is denoted by
  $$
  K[\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n].
  $$

- The smallest **subfield** of $L$ containing $K$ and $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ is denoted by
  $$
  K(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n).
  $$

---

### Proposition

1.
$$
K[\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n]
=
\{ f(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \mid f(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in K[x_1, \dots, x_n] \}.
$$

2.
$$
K(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)
=
\left\{
\frac{f(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)}{g(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)}
\;\middle|\;
f,g \in K[x_1, \dots, x_n],\;
g(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \neq 0
\right\}.
$$

---

### Proof (Sketch)

- The right-hand side of (1) is a ring.
- The right-hand side of (2) is the field of fractions of the ring in (1).

Let $R$ be any ring containing $K$ and $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$.

Since $\alpha_i \in R$, every monomial in $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ lies in $R$.

Because $K \subset R$, we get
$$
f(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in R.
$$

Hence the description is correct.

For (2), take the field of fractions of (1).  
The proof is analogous.

## Generated Subfield

The field
$$
K(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)
$$
is called the **subfield of $L$ generated by $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ over $K$.**

---

## Finitely Generated Extensions

- Every finite extension is finitely generated.
- A finitely generated extension need not be finite.

A finitely generated extension is of the form
$$
K(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n).
$$

We say $L/K$ is finitely generated if
$$
L = K(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)
$$
for some $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n \in L$.

---

## Simple Extensions

An extension $L/K$ is called a **simple extension** if
$$
L = K(\alpha)
$$
for some $\alpha \in L$.

---

### Proposition

If $\alpha, \beta \in L$, then
$$
K(\alpha)(\beta)
=
K(\beta)(\alpha)
=
K(\alpha, \beta).
$$

#### Proof (Idea)

Since
$$
\alpha \in K(\alpha),
$$
we have
$$
K \subset K(\alpha).
$$

Also
$$
\beta \in K(\alpha)(\beta).
$$

Thus
$$
K(\alpha, \beta) \subset K(\alpha)(\beta).
$$

Similarly, the reverse inclusion holds.

More generally,
$$
K(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)
=
K(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{n-1})(\alpha_n).
$$

## Constructing Field Extensions with a Root

Let $K$ be a field and $f(x) \in K[x]$.

We want a field extension of $K$ containing a root of $f$.

Take a maximal ideal $m$ of $K[x]$ containing $(f(x))$.

Then
$$
L = K[x]/m
$$
is a field.

Let
$$
\pi : K[x] \to K[x]/m
$$
be the natural projection and set
$$
\alpha = \pi(x).
$$

Since $K \hookrightarrow K[x] \to K[x]/m$, we get
$$
K \subset L.
$$

Thus $L$ is a field extension of $K$.

Now,
$$
f(\alpha)
=
f(\pi(x))
=
\pi(f(x))
=
0 \text{ in } L.
$$

So $\alpha$ is a root of $f$ in $L$.

---

## Algebraic Construction via a Root

Suppose $f(x)$ is irreducible over $K$ and $\alpha$ is a root.

Define
$$
\phi : K[x] \to K(\alpha),
\quad g(x) \mapsto g(\alpha).
$$

Then
$$
\ker(\phi) = (f(x)).
$$

Hence
$$
K[x]/(f(x))
\cong
K(\alpha).
$$

So
$$
K[x]/(f(x)) \cong K(\alpha).
$$

If $\beta$ is another root of $f$, then
$$
K(\alpha) \cong K(\beta).
$$

(They are isomorphic as extensions of $K$, though not necessarily the same subfield.)

---

If
$$
L = K[x]/(f(x)),
$$
and $\alpha = \pi(x)$, then
$$
L = K(\alpha).
$$

Moreover,
$$
[K(\alpha) : K] = \deg(f).
$$

---

## Example

The numbers $\sqrt[3]{2}$ and $\omega \sqrt[3]{2}$ are two roots of
$$
x^3 - 2 = 0,
$$
where $\omega$ is a root of
$$
x^2 + x + 1 = 0.
$$

Then
$$
\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})
\cong
\mathbb{Q}(\omega \sqrt[3]{2}).
$$

(They are isomorphic as field extensions.)
