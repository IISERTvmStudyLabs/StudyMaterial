## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1 (Folland, p. 21):** Let $X$ be a nonempty set. A $\sigma$-algebra (or $\sigma$-field) on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{M}$ of subsets of $X$ such that:

1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
2. If $A \in \mathcal{M}$, then $A^c \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
3. If $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq \mathcal{M}$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{M}$.
    

**Definition 2 (Rudin, p. 8):** If $\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, there exists a smallest $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$ containing $\mathcal{F}$.

**Proposition 1 (Folland, p. 22):** If $\{\mathcal{M}_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is a collection of $\sigma$-algebras on $X$, then $\bigcap_{\alpha \in A} \mathcal{M}_\alpha$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$.

**Definition 3 (De Barra, p. 19):** The power set of $\Omega$, denoted $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ or $2^\Omega$, is the collection of all subsets of $\Omega$.

---

## Solution

1. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be any $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Omega$. By Definition 1, $\emptyset \in \mathcal{A}$ and $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}$ because $\Omega = \emptyset^c$.
    
2. Let $\mathcal{M}_{min} = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$. We verify that $\mathcal{M}_{min}$ satisfies the axioms of a $\sigma$-algebra. First, $\emptyset \in \mathcal{M}_{min}$. Second, $\emptyset^c = \Omega \in \mathcal{M}_{min}$ and $\Omega^c = \emptyset \in \mathcal{M}_{min}$. Third, for any sequence $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq \mathcal{M}_{min}$, the union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ is either $\emptyset$ (if $A_n = \emptyset$ for all $n$) or $\Omega$ (if $A_n = \Omega$ for at least one $n$). In both cases, the union belongs to $\mathcal{M}_{min}$. Since every $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ must contain $\emptyset$ and $\Omega$, $\mathcal{M}_{min}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra.
    
3. Let $\mathcal{M}_{max} = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. We verify that $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ satisfies the axioms of a $\sigma$-algebra. Since $\emptyset \subseteq \Omega$, $\emptyset \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. If $A \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$, then $A^c \subseteq \Omega$, so $A^c \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. If $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of subsets of $\Omega$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \subseteq \Omega$, so $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$.
    
4. By Definition 3, any $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is a subcollection of $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$, i.e., $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. Thus, $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ is the largest $\sigma$-algebra.
    
5. In summary, the smallest $\sigma$-algebra is the trivial $\sigma$-algebra $\{\emptyset, \Omega\}$, and the largest $\sigma$-algebra is the power set $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: Algebra of Sets (Folland, p. 21)**

An algebra of sets on $\Omega$ is a collection of subsets $\mathcal{M}$ such that:

1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
2. If $E \in \mathcal{M}$, then $E^c \in \mathcal{M}$ (where $E^c = \Omega \setminus E$).
    
3. If $E_1, \dots, E_n \in \mathcal{M}$, then $\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} E_i \in \mathcal{M}$.
    

> **Intuition:** An algebra is a collection of "well-behaved" sets that is closed under the basic operations of taking complements and finite unions. If you have a few shapes in your collection, you must also have their "outsides" and any shape formed by merging a finite number of them.

**Definition 2: $\sigma$-algebra of Sets (Rudin, p. 8)**

A $\sigma$-algebra is an algebra that is also closed under **countable** unions. That is, if $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n \in \mathcal{M}$.

> **Intuition:** A $\sigma$-algebra is a "stronger" version of an algebra. It ensures that even if you merge an infinite (but listable) number of sets from your collection, the resulting set stays within the collection.

**Definition 3: Generated Algebra and $\sigma$-algebra (Folland, p. 22)**

The algebra (or $\sigma$-algebra) generated by a collection of sets $\mathcal{E}$ is the intersection of all algebras (or $\sigma$-algebras) that contain $\mathcal{E}$. It is the smallest such structure containing $\mathcal{E}$.

> **Intuition:** Think of this as the "minimalist" collection. You start with your specific set $A$ and add only the absolute minimum number of other sets required to satisfy the rules of an algebra or $\sigma$-algebra.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Part 1: Describing the Algebra $\mathcal{A}(\{A\})$

1. **Identify the starting members:** By the definition of a generated algebra, $A$ must be in $\mathcal{A}(\{A\})$. By the axioms of an algebra (Definition 1), the empty set $\emptyset$ must also be in the collection.
    
2. **Apply the complement rule:** Since $A \in \mathcal{A}(\{A\})$, its complement $A^c$ must be in $\mathcal{A}(\{A\})$. Similarly, since $\emptyset \in \mathcal{A}(\{A\})$, its complement $\emptyset^c = \Omega$ must be in $\mathcal{A}(\{A\})$.
    
3. **Apply the union rule:** We check if any finite unions of these four sets $\{\emptyset, \Omega, A, A^c\}$ create new sets.
    
    - $A \cup A^c = \Omega$ (already in the set).
        
    - $A \cup \emptyset = A$ (already in the set).
        
    - $A \cup \Omega = \Omega$ (already in the set).
        
        All possible finite unions result in one of the existing four sets.
        
4. **Conclusion for the Algebra:** The collection $\{\emptyset, \Omega, A, A^c\}$ satisfies all the requirements of an algebra and is the smallest collection to do so. Thus:
    
    $$\mathcal{A}(\{A\}) = \{\emptyset, \Omega, A, A^c\}$$
    

---

### Part 2: Describing the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}(\{A\})$

1. **Check for Countable Unions:** By the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra (Definition 2), we must ensure the collection is closed under countable unions.
    
    We take any sequence of sets $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ where each $E_n$ is chosen from $\{\emptyset, \Omega, A, A^c\}$.
    
2. **Evaluate the result:** Because the starting collection $\{\emptyset, \Omega, A, A^c\}$ is finite, any infinite union reduces to a finite union. For example, if we have a sequence like $(A, A^c, A, A^c, \dots)$, the union is simply $A \cup A^c = \Omega$.
    
    Since we already showed in Step 3 of Part 1 that this collection is closed under finite unions, it is automatically closed under countable unions as well.
    
3. **Conclusion for the $\sigma$-algebra:** Every $\sigma$-algebra is an algebra, and in this specific case, the smallest algebra already satisfies the "$\sigma$" (countable) requirement. Therefore, the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $A$ is identical to the algebra generated by $A$.
    
    $$\mathcal{F}(\{A\}) = \{\emptyset, \Omega, A, A^c\}$$
    

**Final Result:**

Both the algebra and the $\sigma$-algebra generated by a single set $A$ are:

$$\{\emptyset, \Omega, A, A^c\}$$

An algebra of sets on $\Omega$ is a collection of subsets $\mathcal{M}$ such that:

1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal{M}$.

3. If $A, B \in \mathcal{M}$, then $A \cup B \in \mathcal{M}$.
    

> **Intuition:** An algebra is a collection that is "closed" under basic logic. If you have a set, you must have its opposite (complement), and if you have two sets, you must have the combination of both (union).

**Definition 2: $\sigma$-algebra (Rudin, p. 8)**

A $\sigma$-algebra is an algebra that is also closed under countable unions. That is, if $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{M}$.

> **Intuition:** This extends the rules of an algebra to include infinite lists of sets. It ensures that if you combine infinitely many sets from your collection in a list, the result doesn't "leak" out of the collection.

**De Morgan's Laws (De Barra, p. 4)**

For any collection of sets $\{A_i\}$, $(\bigcup A_i)^c = \bigcap A_i^c$ and $(\bigcap A_i)^c = \bigcup A_i^c$.

> **Intuition:** These laws provide a way to switch between unions and intersections by using complements.

## Solution

1. To prove $\mathcal{F}_0$ is an algebra, we first verify that $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}_0$. By the problem statement, $\emptyset$ is a finite set. Therefore, $\emptyset$ satisfies the condition for membership in $\mathcal{F}_0$.
    
2. We next verify closure under complements. Let $A \in \mathcal{F}_0$. By the definition of $\mathcal{F}_0$, either $A$ is finite or $A^c$ is finite. If $A$ is finite, then $(A^c)^c = A$ is finite, which means $A^c \in \mathcal{F}_0$. If $A^c$ is finite, then $A^c$ directly satisfies the condition for membership in $\mathcal{F}_0$. In either case, $A^c \in \mathcal{F}_0$.
    
3. We verify closure under finite unions. Let $A, B \in \mathcal{F}_0$. We consider two cases. Case 1: Both $A$ and $B$ are finite. The union of two finite sets is finite, so $A \cup B$ is finite and $A \cup B \in \mathcal{F}_0$. Case 2: At least one set, say $A$, has a finite complement $A^c$. By De Morgan's Laws, $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$. Since $A^c$ is finite, the intersection $A^c \cap B^c$ must also be finite (as it is a subset of $A^c$). Since $(A \cup B)^c$ is finite, $A \cup B \in \mathcal{F}_0$. Thus, $\mathcal{F}_0$ is an algebra.
    
4. To show $\mathcal{F}_0$ is not a $\sigma$-algebra when $\Omega$ is infinite, we must find a countable sequence of sets in $\mathcal{F}_0$ whose union is not in $\mathcal{F}_0$. Since $\Omega$ is infinite, it contains a countably infinite subset $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots\}$ where all $x_n$ are distinct.
    
5. Define $A_n = \{x_{2n}\}$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Each $A_n$ is a singleton set, which is finite, so $A_n \in \mathcal{F}_0$ for all $n$.
    
6. Consider the countable union $A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n = \{x_2, x_4, x_6, \dots\}$. This set $A$ is infinite because it contains infinitely many distinct points.
    
7. Consider the complement $A^c$. Note that $A^c$ contains the set $\{x_1, x_3, x_5, \dots\}$. Since this subset is infinite, $A^c$ is also infinite.
    
8. Since neither $A$ nor $A^c$ is finite, $A \notin \mathcal{F}_0$ by the definition of the set. Because $\mathcal{F}_0$ is not closed under countable unions, it is not a $\sigma$-algebra.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: $\sigma$-algebra of Sets (Folland, p. 21)**

Let $X$ be a nonempty set. A $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$ on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ that satisfies the following:

1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
2. If $A \in \mathcal{M}$, then $A^c \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
3. If $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{M}$.
    

> **Intuition:** A $\sigma$-algebra is a collection of sets that is "stable" under standard operations. If you have a set, you have its opposite; if you have a list of sets, you have their combined total.

**Definition 2: Countable Set (Folland, p. 2)**

A set is countable if it is either finite or has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$.

> **Intuition:** A countable set is one where you can "list" the elements one by one (even if the list never ends).

**Theorem 1: Countable Unions of Countable Sets (Folland, p. 2)**

A countable union of countable sets is itself a countable set.

> **Intuition:** If you have a list of lists, and each list inside is countable, the entire combined collection is still small enough to be listed sequentially.

**De Morgan's Laws (De Barra, p. 4)**

For any collection of sets $\{A_i\}$, the complement of the union is the intersection of the complements: $(\bigcup A_i)^c = \bigcap A_i^c$.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Step 1: Verify that the empty set is in the collection.**

By Definition 2, the empty set $\emptyset$ is finite and therefore countable. According to the definition of $\mathcal{F}_c$, a set belongs to the collection if it is countable. Since $\emptyset$ is countable, $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}_c$.

**Step 2: Verify closure under complements.**

Let $A$ be an element of $\mathcal{F}_c$. By definition, this means either $A$ is countable or $A^c$ is countable.

- If $A$ is countable, then the complement of $A^c$ (which is $A$ itself) is countable. Thus, $A^c$ satisfies the condition "its complement is countable," so $A^c \in \mathcal{F}_c$.
    
- If $A^c$ is countable, then $A^c$ directly satisfies the condition "is a countable set," so $A^c \in \mathcal{F}_c$.
    
    In both scenarios, the collection is closed under complements.
    

**Step 3: Verify closure under countable unions.**

Let $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{F}_c$. We must show that $A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ is in $\mathcal{F}_c$. We consider two possible cases:

- **Case 1: Every set $A_n$ in the sequence is countable.**
    
    By Theorem 1, the union of a countable sequence of countable sets is countable. Therefore, $A = \bigcup A_n$ is countable. Since $A$ is countable, it satisfies the first membership condition of $\mathcal{F}_c$.
    
- **Case 2: At least one set in the sequence has a countable complement.**
    
    Suppose there exists some index $k$ such that $A_k^c$ is countable. We look at the complement of the total union, $A^c = (\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n)^c$. By De Morgan’s Laws, $A^c = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n^c$.
    
    Because $A^c$ is the intersection of all $A_n^c$, it must be a subset of the specific set $A_k^c$ (i.e., $A^c \subseteq A_k^c$). Since $A_k^c$ is countable and any subset of a countable set is countable, $A^c$ is countable. Because $A^c$ is countable, $A$ satisfies the second membership condition of $\mathcal{F}_c$.
    

**Step 4: Conclusion.**

Since $\mathcal{F}_c$ contains the empty set and is closed under both complements and countable unions, it satisfies all requirements in the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra. Therefore, $\mathcal{F}_c$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.

## Question

Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty set and let $\mathcal{C} = \{A_i \mid i \in \mathbb{N}\}$ be a partition of $\Omega$. This means that the sets in $\mathcal{C}$ are pairwise disjoint ($A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$) and their union covers the entire space ($\bigcup_{i \geq 1} A_i = \Omega$).

Define a collection of subsets $\mathcal{F}$ as the set of all possible unions of the elements of the partition:

$$\mathcal{F} = \{ \bigcup_{i \in J} A_i \mid J \subseteq \mathbb{N} \}$$

where we define $\bigcup_{i \in \emptyset} A_i = \emptyset$. Prove that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: $\sigma$-algebra (Folland, p. 21)**

A collection of subsets $\mathcal{M}$ of $\Omega$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if:

1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
2. If $E \in \mathcal{M}$, then its complement $E^c \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
3. If $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n \in \mathcal{M}$.
    

> **Intuition:** A $\sigma$-algebra is a collection of sets that is "complete" under standard logical operations. If you have a set, you must have its opposite; if you have a list of sets, you must have the set that combines them all.

**Definition 2: Partition (De Barra, p. 4)**

A collection of sets $\{A_i\}$ is a partition of $\Omega$ if the sets are mutually exclusive (disjoint) and their total union is $\Omega$.

> **Intuition:** Think of a partition as breaking a puzzle into individual pieces. Every point in the space belongs to exactly one piece, and all pieces together recreate the whole picture.

**De Morgan's Laws (Rudin, p. 7)**

For any collection of sets, the complement of a union is the intersection of the complements, and the complement of an intersection is the union of the complements.

> **Intuition:** These laws provide a bridge between "or" logic (unions) and "and" logic (intersections) when dealing with opposites.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Step 1: Show that the empty set is in $\mathcal{F}$.**

The definition of $\mathcal{F}$ states that for any subset $J \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, the union $\bigcup_{i \in J} A_i$ is in $\mathcal{F}$. If we choose $J = \emptyset$ (which is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$), the definition explicitly provides that $\bigcup_{i \in \emptyset} A_i = \emptyset$. Therefore, by the definition of $\mathcal{F}$, $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$.

**Step 2: Show that the collection is closed under complements.**

Let $E$ be an arbitrary set in $\mathcal{F}$. By the definition of $\mathcal{F}$, there must exist some index set $J \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $E = \bigcup_{i \in J} A_i$.

We need to find the complement $E^c = \Omega \setminus (\bigcup_{i \in J} A_i)$.

Since the collection $\{A_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a partition of $\Omega$, every element in $\Omega$ belongs to exactly one $A_i$. The elements not in $E$ are precisely those that belong to the $A_i$ blocks whose indices are _not_ in $J$.

Thus, $E^c = \bigcup_{i \in J^c} A_i$, where $J^c = \mathbb{N} \setminus J$.

Since $J^c$ is also a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, this union is in $\mathcal{F}$ by the definition of the collection. Thus, $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under complements.

**Step 3: Show that the collection is closed under countable unions.**

Let $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{F}$.

By the definition of $\mathcal{F}$, for each $E_n$, there exists an index set $J_n \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $E_n = \bigcup_{i \in J_n} A_i$.

We consider the union of this sequence:

$$\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \bigcup_{i \in J_n} A_i \right)$$

Using the properties of unions, we can regroup these:

$$\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n = \bigcup_{i \in K} A_i, \text{ where } K = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} J_n$$

Since each $J_n$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, their union $K$ is also a subset of $\mathbb{N}$.

By the definition of $\mathcal{F}$, any union of $A_i$ over an index set $K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is an element of $\mathcal{F}$. Therefore, $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n \in \mathcal{F}$.

**Step 4: Conclusion.**

Since $\mathcal{F}$ contains the empty set and is closed under complements and countable unions, it satisfies the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra.

$$\mathcal{F}_A = \{B \cap A \mid B \in \mathcal{F}\}$$

Prove that $\mathcal{F}_A$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on the set $A$. This is known as the **trace $\sigma$-algebra** (or subspace $\sigma$-algebra) of $\mathcal{F}$ on $A$.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: $\sigma$-algebra (Folland, p. 21)**

Let $X$ be a set. A collection of subsets $\mathcal{M}$ of $X$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if:

1. The empty set $\emptyset$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
    
2. If $E \in \mathcal{M}$, then its complement _relative to X_ (denoted $X \setminus E$) is in $\mathcal{M}$.
    
3. If $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then their union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
    

> **Intuition:** A $\sigma$-algebra is a collection of sets that is "closed" under standard logical operations. If you can define a set using "not" (complements) or "or" (unions) from existing sets in your collection, the result stays in the collection.

**Distributive Law for Sets (De Barra, p. 4)**

For any set $A$ and any collection of sets $\{B_n\}$:

1. $A \cap (\bigcup B_n) = \bigcup (A \cap B_n)$
    
2. $A \cap (\bigcap B_n) = \bigcap (A \cap B_n)$
    

> **Intuition:** This law shows that "intersecting with $A$" can be distributed across unions and intersections, much like multiplication distributes over addition in basic algebra.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Step 1: Verify that the empty set is in $\mathcal{F}_A$.**

By the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra, we know that $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$. According to the definition of the trace $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}_A$, an element is in $\mathcal{F}_A$ if it can be written as $B \cap A$ for some $B \in \mathcal{F}$. If we choose $B = \emptyset$, we get $\emptyset \cap A = \emptyset$. Therefore, $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}_A$.

**Step 2: Verify closure under complements relative to $A$.**

Let $E$ be an arbitrary element in $\mathcal{F}_A$. We must show that its complement _with respect to A_, which is $A \setminus E$, is also in $\mathcal{F}_A$.

1. Since $E \in \mathcal{F}_A$, there exists some $B \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $E = B \cap A$.
    
2. We want to express $A \setminus E$ as an intersection of $A$ with some set in $\mathcal{F}$.
    
3. Note that $A \setminus E = A \setminus (B \cap A) = A \cap B^c$.
    
4. By the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra, since $B \in \mathcal{F}$, its complement $B^c$ (relative to $\Omega$) must also be in $\mathcal{F}$.
    
5. Since $A \setminus E$ is the intersection of $A$ and a set in $\mathcal{F}$ (namely $B^c$), it satisfies the requirement for membership in $\mathcal{F}_A$.
    

**Step 3: Verify closure under countable unions.**

Let $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{F}_A$. We must show that their union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n$ is in $\mathcal{F}_A$.

1. By the definition of $\mathcal{F}_A$, for each $n$, there exists a set $B_n \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $E_n = B_n \cap A$.
    
2. The union of these sets is $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (B_n \cap A)$.
    
3. By the Distributive Law for sets, we can pull the intersection with $A$ out: $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (B_n \cap A) = A \cap (\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n)$.
    
4. By the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra, since each $B_n \in \mathcal{F}$, the countable union $B = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$.
    
5. Because the union of $\{E_n\}$ can be written as $A \cap B$ for a set $B \in \mathcal{F}$, the union is an element of $\mathcal{F}_A$.
    

**Step 4: Conclusion.**

$\mathcal{F}_A$ contains the empty set and is closed under both complements relative to $A$ and countable unions. Thus, by the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra, $\mathcal{F}_A$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on the set $A$.

Consider the semi-algebra $\mathcal{S}$ of semi-open intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ (of the form $(a, b]$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a \leq b$). Prove that $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S}) = \mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: Borel $\sigma$-algebra (Folland, p. 22)**

The Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$, denoted by $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$ (or simply $\mathcal{B}$), is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the family of all open sets in $\mathbb{R}$.

> **Intuition:** The Borel $\sigma$-algebra is the smallest collection of sets that contains every open interval $(a, b)$ and follows the rules of a $\sigma$-algebra. It represents the standard collection of sets we "measure" in real analysis.

**Definition 2: Generated $\sigma$-algebra (Rudin, p. 8)**

If $\mathcal{E}$ is any collection of subsets of $X$, the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{E}$, denoted $\sigma(\mathcal{E})$ or $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{E})$, is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing every set in $\mathcal{E}$.

> **Intuition:** Think of this as the "minimal" $\sigma$-algebra built from a starting kit $\mathcal{E}$. If you have two collections of sets, and every set in the first collection can be built from sets in the second using $\sigma$-algebra rules, then the generated $\sigma$-algebras reflect that relationship.

**Theorem 1: Countable Unions and Intersections (De Barra, p. 7)**

A $\sigma$-algebra is closed under countable unions and countable intersections. Specifically, an open interval $(a, b)$ can be expressed as a countable union of semi-open intervals: $(a, b) = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (a, b - \frac{1}{n}]$.

> **Intuition:** Even though semi-open intervals $(a, b]$ and open intervals $(a, b)$ look different, you can "reach" one from the other by taking an infinite sequence of sets and merging them or finding their overlap.

To prove that two $\sigma$-algebras are equal, we must show that each is a subcollection of the other. Thus, we must prove:

1. $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S}) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$
    
2. $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$
    

**Step 1: Prove that $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S}) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.**

By the definition of a generated $\sigma$-algebra, to show $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S}) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$, it is sufficient to show that every element of $\mathcal{S}$ is contained in $\mathcal{B}$.

- Let $(a, b] \in \mathcal{S}$ be a semi-open interval.
    
- We can write $(a, b] = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} (a, b + \frac{1}{n})$.
    
- Every interval of the form $(a, b + \frac{1}{n})$ is an open set. By the definition of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra, every open set is in $\mathcal{B}$.
    
- Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, it is closed under countable intersections. Therefore, $(a, b] \in \mathcal{B}$.
    
- Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$ is the _smallest_ $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{S}$, it follows that $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S}) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.
    

**Step 2: Prove that $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$.**

By the definition of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra, $\mathcal{B}$ is generated by open sets. In $\mathbb{R}$, every open set is a countable union of open intervals $(a, b)$. Therefore, it is sufficient to show that every open interval $(a, b)$ is in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$.

- Consider an open interval $(a, b)$. We can write this as a countable union of semi-open intervals: $(a, b) = \bigcup_{n=n_0}^{\infty} (a, b - \frac{1}{n}]$, where $n_0$ is large enough such that $a < b - \frac{1}{n_0}$.
    
- Each set $(a, b - \frac{1}{n}]$ is an element of $\mathcal{S}$, and by the definition of a generated $\sigma$-algebra, $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$.
    
- Since $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, it is closed under countable unions. Therefore, $(a, b) \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$.
    
- Since all open intervals are in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$, all open sets (which are countable unions of these intervals) are also in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$.
    
- Since $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing all open sets, and $\mathcal{B}$ is the _smallest_ $\sigma$-algebra containing all open sets, it follows that $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$.
    

**Step 3: Conclusion.**

Because we have shown inclusion in both directions, we conclude that $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S}) = \mathcal{B}$.

## Question

For the semi-algebra $\mathcal{S}$ of semi-open intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ (intervals of the form $(a, b]$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$), how do we know that the generated algebra $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$ is not a $\sigma$-algebra?

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: Algebra of Sets (Folland, p. 21)**

An algebra of sets on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{M}$ of subsets of $X$ that contains the empty set and is closed under complements and finite unions.

> **Intuition:** An algebra allows you to perform basic "building block" operations. If you have a few shapes, you can find their opposites or glue a finite number of them together and still stay within your collection.

**Definition 2: $\sigma$-algebra (Rudin, p. 8)**

A $\sigma$-algebra is an algebra that is also closed under countable unions. That is, if $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of sets in the collection, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ must also be in the collection.

> **Intuition:** This is a "stronger" version of an algebra. It ensures that if you glue together an infinite (but listable) list of shapes, the final result is still a shape that your collection recognizes.

**Proposition 1: Structure of the Algebra Generated by Intervals (De Barra, p. 32)**

The algebra $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$ generated by the semi-open intervals $\mathcal{S}$ consists of all sets that can be written as a **finite** union of disjoint semi-open intervals.

> **Intuition:** If you start with intervals like $(0, 1]$, you can only create sets like $(0, 1] \cup (2, 5]$ using the rules of an algebra. You can never create something that requires "gluing" infinitely many separate pieces together.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Solution**

1. **Identify the elements of the algebra:** By the property of generated algebras for intervals, any set $E$ in $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$ must be representable as a finite union of disjoint semi-open intervals of the form $(a_i, b_i]$.
    
2. **Construct a countable union of elements:** We can choose a sequence of sets from the semi-algebra $\mathcal{S}$ (which are also in the algebra $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$). Let $A_n = (\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{1}{n}]$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$. Each $A_n$ is a valid semi-open interval.
    
3. **Determine the result of the infinite union:** Consider the countable union of these sets:
    
    $$E = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{1}{n}\right] = (0, 1]$$
    
    While this specific union results in an interval $(0, 1]$ which _is_ in the algebra, we need to find a union that results in a set that **cannot** be written as a finite union of semi-open intervals.
    
4. **Construct a counterexample:** Consider the set of open intervals $B_n = (n + \frac{1}{4}, n + \frac{1}{2}]$. These are all disjoint and belong to $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$. Now, define the countable union:
    
    $$U = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (n + \frac{1}{4}, n + \frac{1}{2}]$$
    
    , (2.25, 2.5], (3.25, 3.5], \dots$ extending to infinity]
    
5. **Apply the definition of $\sigma$-algebra:** If $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$ were a $\sigma$-algebra, then by the definition of closure under countable unions, $U$ would have to be in $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$.
    
6. **Verify membership:** However, by Proposition 1, every set in $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$ must be a **finite** union of intervals. The set $U$ consists of infinitely many disjoint components that are separated from each other. It cannot be simplified or rewritten into a union of finitely many semi-open intervals.
    
7. **Conclusion:** Since we have found a countable union of sets from the algebra that results in a set not contained within the algebra, $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S})$ is not closed under countable unions. Therefore, it is not a $\sigma$-algebra.

Prove that every countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is in $\mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{B}$ denotes the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: Borel $\sigma$-algebra (Folland, p. 22)**

The Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets of $\mathbb{R}$.

> **Intuition:** This is the smallest collection of sets that contains all open intervals and obeys the standard rules of a $\sigma$-algebra (closure under complements and countable unions).

**Definition 2: $\sigma$-algebra Properties (Rudin, p. 8)**

By the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra, if a collection $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, then:

1. It is closed under countable unions.
    
2. It is closed under complements, which implies it is also closed under countable intersections.
    

> **Intuition:** If you have a list of sets that are "in," then their total combination (union) and their common overlap (intersection) are also "in."

**Theorem 1: Points as Intersections of Open Sets (De Barra, p. 7)**

Any singleton set $\{x\}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ can be expressed as the intersection of a sequence of open intervals: $\{x\} = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} (x - \frac{1}{n}, x + \frac{1}{n})$.

> **Intuition:** While a single point isn't "open," you can trap it by taking a sequence of shrinking open intervals that squeeze down onto that one point.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Solution**

To prove that any countable set is in the Borel $\sigma$-algebra, we first show that a set containing a single point is Borel, and then we use the property of countable unions.

1. **Prove that singleton sets are Borel sets.**
    
    Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. As stated in Theorem 1, we can write the singleton set $\{x\}$ as:
    
    $$\{x\} = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(x - \frac{1}{n}, x + \frac{1}{n}\right)$$
    
    By the definition of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra, every open interval $(x - \frac{1}{n}, x + \frac{1}{n})$ is an open set and thus belongs to $\mathcal{B}$. By the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra, the collection is closed under countable intersections. Therefore, $\{x\} \in \mathcal{B}$ for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
    
2. **Define a countable set.**
    
    Let $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a countable set. By the definition of countability, we can list the elements of $C$ as a sequence $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots\}$. We can then express the set $C$ as the union of these individual points:
    
    $$C = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} \{x_i\}$$
    
3. **Apply the property of countable unions.**
    
    In Step 1, we established that each singleton set $\{x_i\}$ is an element of $\mathcal{B}$. By the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra, $\mathcal{B}$ must be closed under countable unions. Since $C$ is a countable union of sets that are each in $\mathcal{B}$, then $C$ itself must be in $\mathcal{B}$.
    
4. **Conclusion.**
    
    Every countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ can be constructed from Borel sets using the allowed operation of countable union. Thus, every countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is a Borel set.

## Question

Prove that any nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is a countable union of disjoint open intervals. Furthermore, show that any nonempty open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a countable union of open rectangles (sets of the form $(a_1, b_1) \times \dots \times (a_d, b_d)$), though these may not necessarily be disjoint.

---

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: Open Set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (Folland, p. 13)**

A set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is open if for every $x \in U$, there exists an open ball $B(x, r) = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^d : |x-y| < r\}$ such that $B(x, r) \subseteq U$.

> **Intuition:** An open set is a set where every point has some "breathing room" around it that is also entirely contained within the set.

**Definition 2: Density of Rational Numbers (Folland, p. 2)**

The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ (or $\mathbb{Q}^d$ in higher dimensions) is countable and dense in $\mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{R}^d$). This means every nonempty open set contains at least one point with rational coordinates.

> **Intuition:** Rational points are spread everywhere. No matter how small an open interval or box you pick, you will always find a point with rational coordinates inside it.

**Definition 3: Connected Component (Folland, p. 34)**

In the context of $\mathbb{R}$, the connected components of an open set are the maximal open intervals contained within that set.

> **Intuition:** If you look at an open set on a number line, it might be made of several "pieces." Each continuous, unbroken piece is a connected component.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Part 1: Open Sets in $\mathbb{R}$

1. **Define the Components:** Let $U$ be a nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$. For each $x \in U$, let $I_x$ be the largest open interval such that $x \in I_x$ and $I_x \subseteq U$. This is the connected component of $U$ containing $x$.
    
2. **Establish Disjointness:** By the definition of maximal intervals, if two such intervals $I_x$ and $I_y$ have any point in common, they must be the exact same interval. Therefore, the collection of all such distinct intervals $\{I_\alpha\}$ is pairwise disjoint, and their union is exactly $U$.
    
3. **Prove Countability:** By the density of rational numbers (Definition 2), every nonempty open interval $I_\alpha$ must contain at least one rational number $q_\alpha$. Since the intervals are disjoint, each $q_\alpha$ must be unique to its interval. Because the set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, the collection of disjoint intervals must also be countable.
    
4. **Conclusion for $\mathbb{R}$:** Thus, $U$ is the union of a countable collection of disjoint open intervals.
    

---

### Part 2: Open Sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$

1. **Define the Base of Rectangles:** Let $U$ be a nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Consider the collection $\mathcal{R}$ of all open rectangles with rational endpoints (i.e., $(a_1, b_1) \times \dots \times (a_d, b_d)$ where all $a_i, b_i \in \mathbb{Q}$) that are entirely contained within $U$.
    
2. **Prove the Union Equals $U$:** By the definition of an open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (Definition 1), for any point $x \in U$, there is an open ball around it contained in $U$. Inside that ball, we can always fit an open rectangle with rational endpoints that contains $x$. Therefore, every point $x \in U$ is inside at least one rectangle from our collection $\mathcal{R}$. This means the union of all rectangles in $\mathcal{R}$ is exactly $U$.
    
3. **Prove Countability:** The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. Since a rectangle in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is defined by $2d$ rational numbers (a starting and ending point for each dimension), the total number of such rectangles is a countable product of countable sets. By Theorem 1 from our previous lecture (De Barra, p. 7), this resulting collection $\mathcal{R}$ is countable.
    
4. **Conclusion for $\mathbb{R}^d$:** Unlike the 1-dimensional case, these rectangles can overlap significantly, but they still successfully cover $U$ using only a countable number of elements. Thus, $U$ is a countable union of open rectangles.

Every open set in $\mathbb{R}$ can be written as a countable union of open intervals. Furthermore, every open interval $(a, b)$ is a countable union of intervals with rational endpoints.

> **Intuition:** Because rational numbers are "everywhere" (dense), we can approximate any interval or open set using only a countable list of intervals that have rational coordinates.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Solution**

To prove $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_i) = \mathcal{B}$, we show two inclusions for each case: $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_i) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_i)$.

### 1. Proving $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1) = \mathcal{B}$

1. **First Inclusion:** Every set in $\mathcal{C}_1$ is an open interval of the form $(-\infty, x)$. By the definition of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra, every open set is in $\mathcal{B}$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{C}_1$, it must contain the smallest $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{C}_1$. Thus, $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.
    
2. **Second Inclusion:** Any open interval $(a, b)$ can be written as $(-\infty, b) \cap (-\infty, a]^c$. Since $(-\infty, a] = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} (-\infty, a + \frac{1}{n})$, and each $(-\infty, a + \frac{1}{n}) \in \mathcal{C}_1$, then $(-\infty, a]$ is in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1)$ by closure under countable intersections. Its complement is also in the $\sigma$-algebra. Thus, $(a, b) \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1)$. By Theorem 1, all open sets are countable unions of such intervals, so $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1)$.
    

### 2. Proving $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2) = \mathcal{B}$

1. **First Inclusion:** Since $\mathcal{C}_2 \subset \mathcal{C}_1$, and we already showed $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$, it follows immediately that $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.
    
2. **Second Inclusion:** For any $x \in \mathbb{R}$, we can choose a sequence of rationals $q_n$ such that $q_n \uparrow x$. Then $(-\infty, x) = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (-\infty, q_n)$. Since each $(-\infty, q_n) \in \mathcal{C}_2$, the union is in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2)$. This shows $\mathcal{C}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2)$. Consequently, $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1) \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2)$. Since we already established $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1)$, we have $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2)$.
    

### 3. Proving $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_3) = \mathcal{B}$

1. **First Inclusion:** Every set $(a, b)$ with $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}$ is an open set. By the definition of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra, these are all in $\mathcal{B}$. Therefore, $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_3) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.
    
2. **Second Inclusion:** By Theorem 1, any open interval $(x, y)$ can be written as a countable union of intervals with rational endpoints. For example, $(x, y) = \bigcup \{ (a, b) : a, b \in \mathbb{Q}, x < a < b < y \}$. 3. Since this is a countable union of elements from $\mathcal{C}_3$, every open interval is in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_3)$. Because every open set is a countable union of open intervals, all open sets are in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_3)$. Thus, $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_3)$.
    

**Conclusion:**

In all three cases, the generated $\sigma$-algebra is exactly the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Solution**

To prove $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_i) = \mathcal{B}$, we must show that $\mathcal{C}_i \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ and that $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_i)$.

### 1. Proving $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1) = \mathcal{B}$

1. **First Inclusion:** Every set in $\mathcal{C}_1$ is an open rectangle. By the definition of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra, all open sets are in $\mathcal{B}$. Thus, $\mathcal{C}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{B}$, which implies $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.
    
2. **Second Inclusion:** By Theorem 1, any open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a countable union of open rectangles. Since $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1)$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing all open rectangles, it must contain all open sets. Therefore, $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_1)$.
    

### 2. Proving $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2) = \mathcal{B}$

1. **First Inclusion:** The sets in $\mathcal{C}_2$ are open "lower-left" infinite rectangles. Since these are open sets, $\mathcal{C}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{B}$, so $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.
    
2. **Second Inclusion:** A finite rectangle $(a_i, b_i)$ in one dimension can be written as $(-\infty, b_i) \cap (-\infty, a_i]^c$. In $d$ dimensions, we can construct any rectangle in $\mathcal{C}_1$ using intersections and complements of sets in $\mathcal{C}_2$. For example, the closed-left interval $(-\infty, a_i] = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty (-\infty, a_i + 1/n)$. Since $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2)$ is closed under these operations, $\mathcal{C}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2)$, implying $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2)$.
    

### 3. Proving $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_3) = \mathcal{B}$

1. **First Inclusion:** $\mathcal{C}_3 \subset \mathcal{C}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{B}$. Thus, $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_3) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.
    
2. **Second Inclusion:** For any $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $(-\infty, x_1) \times \dots \times (-\infty, x_d)$ is the countable union of sets from $\mathcal{C}_3$ where the coordinates are rational sequences $q_{i,n} \uparrow x_i$. This shows $\mathcal{C}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_3)$, and since $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_2)$, it follows that $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_3)$.
    

### 4. Proving $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_4) = \mathcal{B}$

1. **First Inclusion:** $\mathcal{C}_4$ consists of open rectangles with rational endpoints. These are open sets, so $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_4) \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.
    
2. **Second Inclusion:** By Theorem 1, every open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a countable union of rectangles with rational coordinates. These rectangles are exactly the elements of $\mathcal{C}_4$. Since $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_4)$ is closed under countable unions, it contains all open sets, meaning $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_4)$.
    

**Conclusion:**

All four collections generate the same Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$.

**Definition 1: $\sigma$-algebra generated by a collection (Folland, p. 22)**

The $\sigma$-algebra generated by a collection $\mathcal{E}$, denoted $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{E})$, is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all sets in $\mathcal{E}$.

The collection $\mathcal{F}_c$ consists of all subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ that are either countable or have a countable complement.

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Solution**

### Part 1: Proving $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}) = \mathcal{F}_c$

1. **Show that $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}) \subseteq \mathcal{F}_c$:** Every element in $\mathcal{C}$ is a singleton set $\{x\}$, which is finite and therefore countable. Since every set in $\mathcal{C}$ is countable, every set in $\mathcal{C}$ belongs to $\mathcal{F}_c$ by the definition of the countable-cocountable $\sigma$-algebra. Because $\mathcal{F}_c$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{C}$, and $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C})$ is the _smallest_ such $\sigma$-algebra, it follows that $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}) \subseteq \mathcal{F}_c$.
    
2. **Show that $\mathcal{F}_c \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C})$:** Let $A$ be a set in $\mathcal{F}_c$. By definition, $A$ is either countable or $A^c$ is countable.
    
    - If $A$ is countable, we can write $A = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} \{x_i\}$. Since each singleton $\{x_i\}$ is in $\mathcal{C}$, the countable union must be in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C})$ by the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra.
        
    - If $A^c$ is countable, then by the same logic, $A^c \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C})$. Since a $\sigma$-algebra is closed under complements, $(A^c)^c = A$ must also be in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C})$.
        
        Thus, every set in $\mathcal{F}_c$ is in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C})$, so $\mathcal{F}_c \subseteq \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C})$.
        
3. **Conclusion for Part 1:** Since we have inclusion in both directions, $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}) = \mathcal{F}_c$.
    

### Part 2: Proving $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C})$ is properly contained in $\mathcal{B}$

1. **Show Inclusion ($\mathcal{F}_c \subseteq \mathcal{B}$):** We previously proved that every countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is a Borel set. Since every $A \in \mathcal{F}_c$ is either countable (meaning $A \in \mathcal{B}$) or its complement is countable (meaning $A^c \in \mathcal{B}$, and thus $A \in \mathcal{B}$), we have $\mathcal{F}_c \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.
    
2. **Show "Proper" Inclusion ($\mathcal{F}_c \neq \mathcal{B}$):** To show the containment is proper, we must find a Borel set that is not in $\mathcal{F}_c$. Consider the open interval $I = (0, 1)$.
    
    - $I$ is an open set, so by definition, $I \in \mathcal{B}$.
        
    - Is $I \in \mathcal{F}_c$? An interval $(0, 1)$ is uncountable. Furthermore, its complement $I^c = (-\infty, 0] \cup [1, \infty)$ is also uncountable.
        
    - Since neither $I$ nor $I^c$ is countable, $I \notin \mathcal{F}_c$.
        
3. **Conclusion for Part 2:** Because there are Borel sets (like intervals) that are not in $\mathcal{F}_c$, the collection $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C})$ is properly contained in $\mathcal{B}$.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: $\sigma$-algebra (Folland, p. 21)**

A collection of subsets $\mathcal{M}$ of a set $X$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if:

1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
2. If $E \in \mathcal{M}$, then its complement $E^c \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
3. If $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then their union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n \in \mathcal{M}$.
    

> **Intuition:** A $\sigma$-algebra is a collection of sets that is "closed" under standard operations. If you have a set, you have its opposite; if you have a list of sets, you have the set formed by combining them all together.

**Definition 2: Generated $\sigma$-algebra (Rudin, p. 8)**

If $\mathcal{E}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{E}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains every set in $\mathcal{E}$.

> **Intuition:** This is the "minimalist" $\sigma$-algebra. You start with a few basic building blocks and add only what is strictly necessary to satisfy the rules of a $\sigma$-algebra.

**Definition 3: Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$ (Folland, p. 22)**

The Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets (or open intervals) of $\mathbb{R}$.

> **Intuition:** This is the standard collection of "measurable" sets on the real line, including intervals, points, and anything that can be built from them.

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Solution**

To prove the equality of two collections, we let $\mathcal{M} = \{A \cup B \mid A \in \mathcal{B}, B \subseteq \{-\infty, \infty\}\}$ and show that $\overline{\mathcal{B}} = \mathcal{M}$. This requires two steps: showing $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra that contains the generating sets, and showing that any $\sigma$-algebra containing the generating sets must contain $\mathcal{M}$.

**Step 1: Prove that $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.**

We check the three axioms of a $\sigma$-algebra for the collection $\mathcal{M}$:

1. **Empty set:** Since $\emptyset \in \mathcal{B}$ and $\emptyset \subseteq \{-\infty, \infty\}$, we have $\emptyset \cup \emptyset = \emptyset \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
2. **Complements:** Let $E = A \cup B \in \mathcal{M}$, where $A \in \mathcal{B}$ and $B \subseteq \{-\infty, \infty\}$. Its complement in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is $E^c = \overline{\mathbb{R}} \setminus (A \cup B)$. Since $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $B \subseteq \{-\infty, \infty\}$, we can write this as $(\mathbb{R} \setminus A) \cup (\{-\infty, \infty\} \setminus B)$. Because $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$, $A^c = \mathbb{R} \setminus A$ is in $\mathcal{B}$. The set $B' = \{-\infty, \infty\} \setminus B$ is clearly a subset of $\{-\infty, \infty\}$. Thus, $E^c \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
3. **Countable Unions:** Let $E_n = A_n \cup B_n$ be a sequence in $\mathcal{M}$. Then $\bigcup E_n = (\bigcup A_n) \cup (\bigcup B_n)$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, $A = \bigcup A_n \in \mathcal{B}$. The set $B = \bigcup B_n$ is still a subset of $\{-\infty, \infty\}$. Thus, $\bigcup E_n \in \mathcal{M}$.
    

**Step 2: Prove that $\overline{\mathcal{B}} \subseteq \mathcal{M}$.**

By Definition 2, $\overline{\mathcal{B}}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{B}$, $\{\infty\}$, and $\{-\infty\}$.

1. Every $A \in \mathcal{B}$ is in $\mathcal{M}$ (by taking $B = \emptyset$).
    
2. The set $\{\infty\}$ is in $\mathcal{M}$ (by taking $A = \emptyset$ and $B = \{\infty\}$).
    
3. The set $\{-\infty\}$ is in $\mathcal{M}$ (by taking $A = \emptyset$ and $B = \{-\infty\}$).
    
    Since $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra (from Step 1) that contains all the generating sets of $\overline{\mathcal{B}}$, the smallest such $\sigma$-algebra must be contained within it. Thus, $\overline{\mathcal{B}} \subseteq \mathcal{M}$.
    

**Step 3: Prove that $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \overline{\mathcal{B}}$.**

Let $E = A \cup B$ be an arbitrary element of $\mathcal{M}$.

1. By the definition of $\overline{\mathcal{B}}$, it contains $\mathcal{B}$. Thus $A \in \overline{\mathcal{B}}$.
    
2. By the definition of $\overline{\mathcal{B}}$, it contains $\{\infty\}$ and $\{-\infty\}$. Any subset $B$ of $\{-\infty, \infty\}$ is a finite union of these sets (or the empty set), so $B \in \overline{\mathcal{B}}$ by the union axiom of $\sigma$-algebras.
    
3. Since $A \in \overline{\mathcal{B}}$ and $B \in \overline{\mathcal{B}}$, their union $A \cup B$ must also be in $\overline{\mathcal{B}}$. Thus, $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \overline{\mathcal{B}}$.
    

**Step 4: Conclusion.**

Since $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \overline{\mathcal{B}}$ and $\overline{\mathcal{B}} \subseteq \mathcal{M}$, we conclude that $\overline{\mathcal{B}} = \{A \cup B \mid A \in \mathcal{B}, B \subseteq \{-\infty, \infty\}\}$.

## Question

Let $X$ and $Y$ be nonempty sets and $f : X \to Y$ be a given function. For any subset $A \subseteq Y$, we define the preimage (inverse image) of $A$ under $f$ as:

$$f^{-1}(A) = \{x \in X \mid f(x) \in A\}$$

Note that this definition holds even if the inverse function $f^{-1}$ does not exist.

Prove that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $Y$, then the collection

$$\mathcal{F}_f = \{f^{-1}(A) \mid A \in \mathcal{F}\}$$

is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

**Definition 1: $\sigma$-algebra (Folland, p. 21)**

A collection of subsets $\mathcal{M}$ of a set $X$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if:

1. The empty set $\emptyset$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
    
2. If $E \in \mathcal{M}$, then its complement $E^c = X \setminus E$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
    
3. If $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then their union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
    

> **Intuition:** A $\sigma$-algebra is a collection that is "closed" under basic set operations. If you start with sets in the collection and apply "not" (complement) or "or" (union), the result stays in the collection.

**Theorem 1: Properties of Preimages (De Barra, p. 2)**

For any function $f: X \to Y$, the following set-theoretic properties hold for subsets of $Y$:

1. $f^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$ and $f^{-1}(Y) = X$.
    
2. $f^{-1}(A^c) = [f^{-1}(A)]^c$.
    
3. $f^{-1}(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n) = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} f^{-1}(A_n)$.
    

> **Intuition:** Preimages are very "well-behaved" compared to direct images. They preserve all standard set operations like unions, intersections, and complements perfectly.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Solution**

To prove that $\mathcal{F}_f$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$, we must verify the three axioms of the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra.

**Step 1: Verify that the empty set is in $\mathcal{F}_f$.**

1. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $Y$, we know that $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$ by the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra.
    
2. By the properties of preimages, $f^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$.
    
3. Since $\emptyset$ can be written as the preimage of a set in $\mathcal{F}$ (namely, $\emptyset$ itself), it follows by the definition of $\mathcal{F}_f$ that $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}_f$.
    

**Step 2: Verify closure under complements.**

1. Let $E$ be an arbitrary set in $\mathcal{F}_f$. We must show that $E^c \in \mathcal{F}_f$.
    
2. By the definition of $\mathcal{F}_f$, there must exist a set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $E = f^{-1}(A)$.
    
3. The complement of $E$ in $X$ is $E^c = [f^{-1}(A)]^c$.
    
4. By the property of preimages stated in Theorem 1, $[f^{-1}(A)]^c = f^{-1}(A^c)$.
    
5. Since $A \in \mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, its complement $A^c$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$.
    
6. Because $E^c$ is the preimage of a set in $\mathcal{F}$ (the set $A^c$), it satisfies the requirement to be in $\mathcal{F}_f$.
    

**Step 3: Verify closure under countable unions.**

1. Let $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{F}_f$. We must show that $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n \in \mathcal{F}_f$.
    
2. By the definition of $\mathcal{F}_f$, for each $n$, there exists a set $A_n \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $E_n = f^{-1}(A_n)$.
    
3. The union of our sequence is $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} f^{-1}(A_n)$.
    
4. By the property of preimages stated in Theorem 1, the union of preimages is the preimage of the union: $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} f^{-1}(A_n) = f^{-1}(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n)$.
    
5. Since each $A_n \in \mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, the countable union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ is also an element of $\mathcal{F}$.
    
6. Because the union of the $E_n$ sequence is expressed as the preimage of a set in $\mathcal{F}$, the union belongs to $\mathcal{F}_f$.
    

**Step 4: Conclusion.**

Since $\mathcal{F}_f$ contains the empty set and is closed under complements and countable unions, it satisfies the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$.

**Definition 1: $\sigma$-algebra (Folland, p. 21)**

A collection of subsets $\mathcal{F}$ of $X$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if it contains the empty set and is closed under complements and countable unions.

> **Intuition:** A $\sigma$-algebra is a collection of sets where you can always perform basic "logic" (and, or, not) infinitely many times without leaving the collection.

A partition of $X$ is a collection of disjoint nonempty sets whose union is $X$.

> **Intuition:** Even if you can count the items in a set, you cannot count all the different ways to group them together.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

**Solution**

### (a) Proving $X$ is infinite

1. Suppose $X$ is a finite set. If $X$ is finite, the total number of its subsets is also finite ($2^{|X|}$).
    
2. Since any $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ is a subcollection of the power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$, $\mathcal{F}$ must also be finite.
    
3. This contradicts the hypothesis that $\mathcal{F}$ is infinite. Thus, $X$ must be infinite.
    

### (b) Smallest set containing $x$

1. By the definition of $f(x)$, it is the intersection of all sets $A$ in $\mathcal{F}$ that contain $x$.
    
2. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is assumed to be a countably infinite set in this step, this intersection is a countable intersection of sets in $\mathcal{F}$.
    
3. By the properties of a $\sigma$-algebra (Theorem 1), $f(x)$ belongs to $\mathcal{F}$.
    
4. Since every $A$ in the intersection contains $x$, their intersection $f(x)$ also contains $x$. By construction, any $B \in \mathcal{F}$ containing $x$ is one of the sets being intersected, so $f(x) \subseteq B$. Thus, $f(x)$ is the smallest set in $\mathcal{F}$ containing $x$.
    

### (c) Disjoint or Identical (Partition)

1. Suppose $f(x) \cap f(y) \neq \emptyset$ and let $z \in f(x) \cap f(y)$.
    
2. Since $z \in f(x)$ and $f(z)$ is the smallest set in $\mathcal{F}$ containing $z$, we have $f(z) \subseteq f(x)$.
    
3. If $f(z)$ were a proper subset of $f(x)$, then $x$ could not be in $f(z)$ (otherwise $f(x)$ wouldn't be the smallest). However, if $x \notin f(z)$, we could consider $f(x) \setminus f(z)$, which is a set in $\mathcal{F}$ containing $x$ smaller than $f(x)$, a contradiction.
    
4. Thus $f(z) = f(x)$. By symmetry, $f(z) = f(y)$, so $f(x) = f(y)$.
    
5. Since every $x \in X$ is in exactly one such set $f(x)$, the collection $f(X)$ forms a partition of $X$.
    

### (d) Representing $A$ as a union

1. For any $x \in A$, we have $f(x) \subseteq A$ because $A$ is a set in $\mathcal{F}$ containing $x$, and $f(x)$ is the smallest such set.
    
2. Taking the union over all $x \in A$, we get $\bigcup_{x \in A} f(x) \subseteq A$.
    
3. Since every $x \in A$ is contained in its own $f(x)$, we also have $A \subseteq \bigcup_{x \in A} f(x)$. Thus, $A = \bigcup_{x \in A} f(x)$.
    

### (e) $f(X)$ is an infinite subset

1. If $f(X)$ were a finite collection of sets $\{E_1, E_2, \dots, E_n\}$, then every set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ would be a union of some sub-collection of these $n$ sets (by part d).z
    
2. This would mean $\mathcal{F}$ has at most $2^n$ elements, making $\mathcal{F}$ finite.
    
3. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is infinite, $f(X)$ must be an infinite collection of disjoint sets.
    

### (f) $\mathcal{F}$ must be uncountable

1. From part (e), $f(X)$ contains a countably infinite sequence of disjoint sets $\{E_1, E_2, E_3, \dots\}$.
    
2. For any subset of indices $J \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, we can define a set $A_J = \bigcup_{j \in J} E_j$.
    
3. By the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra, every such countable union $A_J$ is in $\mathcal{F}$.
    
4. Since the sets $E_j$ are disjoint, different index sets $J$ produce different sets $A_J$.
    
5. The number of such sets is equal to the number of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$, which is uncountable (Theorem 2).
