Consider $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \nu)$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra over $\Omega$ and $\nu$ is a premeasure. Let $\nu^*$ be the outer measure on $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ induced by $\nu$, and let $\mathcal{M}$ be the corresponding $\sigma$-algebra of $\nu^*$-measurable sets, defined by:

$$\mathcal{M} = \{E \subseteq \Omega : \nu^*(A) = \nu^*(A \cap E) + \nu^*(A \cap E^c), \forall A \subseteq \Omega\}$$

(Note: The image contains a slight typo in the definition of $\mathcal{M}$ by using $\nu$ instead of $\nu^*$; the standard Carathéodory condition uses the outer measure $\nu^*$).

- **(a)** If $\nu^*(E) = 0$, then prove that $E \in \mathcal{M}$.
    
- **(b)** Prove that if $\nu^*(A) = 0$, then $\nu^*(A \cup B) = \nu^*(B)$ for any $B \subseteq \Omega$.
    
- **(c)** If $F \in \mathcal{M}$ and $\nu^*(F \Delta E) = 0$, then prove that $E \in \mathcal{M}$, where $F \Delta E = (F \setminus E) \cup (E \setminus F)$.
    
- **(d)** Prove that for any $A \subseteq \Omega$, there exists $B \in \sigma(\mathcal{A})$ such that $A \subseteq B$ and $\nu^*(A) = \nu^*(B)$. (Note: The image uses $\mathcal{F}(A)$, which typically denotes the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the algebra $\mathcal{A}$).

## Definitions and Theorems Used

From **Folland, G. B. (Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications)**:

1. **Outer Measure Definition:** For any $A \subseteq \Omega$, $\nu^*(A) = \inf \{ \sum_{j=1}^\infty \nu(E_j) : E_j \in \mathcal{A}, A \subseteq \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_j \}$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ We approximate the "size" of any set from the outside using a countable union of simple pieces from our algebra.
        
2. **Monotonicity of Outer Measure:** If $A \subseteq B$, then $\nu^*(A) \leq \nu^*(B)$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ A part cannot be larger than the whole.
        
3. **Countable Subadditivity:** $\nu^*(\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty A_j) \leq \sum_{j=1}^\infty \nu^*(A_j)$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ The total size of a combined set is at most the sum of the sizes of its individual parts.
        
4. **Carathéodory Condition:** A set $E$ is measurable if it splits every "test set" $A$ additively. Since subadditivity always holds ($\nu^*(A) \leq \nu^*(A \cap E) + \nu^*(A \cap E^c)$), we only need to show:
    
    $$\nu^*(A) \geq \nu^*(A \cap E) + \nu^*(A \cap E^c)$$

## Solution

### Part (a)

**Goal:** Prove that if $\nu^*(E) = 0$, then $E \in \mathcal{M}$.

1. Pick an arbitrary "test set" $A \subseteq \Omega$.
    
2. By the **Monotonicity** of outer measure, since $(A \cap E) \subseteq E$ and $\nu^*(E) = 0$, we have $\nu^*(A \cap E) = 0$.
    
3. Similarly, since $(A \cap E^c) \subseteq A$, by **Monotonicity** we have $\nu^*(A \cap E^c) \leq \nu^*(A)$.
    
4. Adding these two results:
    
    $$\nu^*(A \cap E) + \nu^*(A \cap E^c) = 0 + \nu^*(A \cap E^c) \leq \nu^*(A)$$
    
5. This satisfies the Carathéodory criterion. Therefore, any set with outer measure zero is measurable.
    

### Part (b)

**Goal:** Prove that if $\nu^*(A) = 0$, then $\nu^*(A \cup B) = \nu^*(B)$.

1. By **Monotonicity**, since $B \subseteq (A \cup B)$, we know that $\nu^*(B) \leq \nu^*(A \cup B)$.
    
2. By **Countable Subadditivity** (specifically finite subadditivity):
    
    $$\nu^*(A \cup B) \leq \nu^*(A) + \nu^*(B)$$
    
3. Since $\nu^*(A) = 0$, the inequality becomes $\nu^*(A \cup B) \leq 0 + \nu^*(B) = \nu^*(B)$.
    
4. Since we have shown $\nu^*(B) \leq \nu^*(A \cup B)$ and $\nu^*(A \cup B) \leq \nu^*(B)$, it follows that $\nu^*(A \cup B) = \nu^*(B)$.
    

### Part (c)

**Goal:** If $F \in \mathcal{M}$ and $\nu^*(F \Delta E) = 0$, then $E \in \mathcal{M}$.

1. Recall that $E = (F \setminus (F \setminus E)) \cup (E \setminus F)$.
    
2. Let $N_1 = F \setminus E$ and $N_2 = E \setminus F$. Since $F \Delta E = N_1 \cup N_2$ and $\nu^*(F \Delta E) = 0$, by **Monotonicity**, $\nu^*(N_1) = 0$ and $\nu^*(N_2) = 0$.
    
3. By **Part (a)**, since $N_1$ and $N_2$ have outer measure zero, they are both in $\mathcal{M}$.
    
4. We can express $E$ using set operations: $E = (F \cap N_1^c) \cup N_2$.
    
5. Since $F, N_1^c,$ and $N_2$ are all elements of the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$, and $\sigma$-algebras are closed under complements, intersections, and unions, $E$ must also be in $\mathcal{M}$.
    

### Part (d)

**Goal:** For any $A \subseteq \Omega$, find $B \in \sigma(\mathcal{A})$ such that $A \subseteq B$ and $\nu^*(A) = \nu^*(B)$.

1. By the **Definition of Outer Measure**, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a sequence of sets $\{E_{n,j}\}_{j=1}^\infty \subseteq \mathcal{A}$ such that $A \subseteq \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_{n,j}$ and:
    
    $$\sum_{j=1}^\infty \nu(E_{n,j}) \leq \nu^*(A) + \frac{1}{n}$$
    
2. Let $B_n = \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_{n,j}$. Since $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{A})$ and $\sigma$-algebras are closed under countable unions, $B_n \in \sigma(\mathcal{A})$.
    
3. By **Countable Subadditivity** and the fact that $\nu = \nu^*$ on $\mathcal{A}$, we have $\nu^*(B_n) \leq \sum_{j=1}^\infty \nu(E_{n,j}) \leq \nu^*(A) + \frac{1}{n}$.
    
4. Define $B = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty B_n$. Since $B$ is a countable intersection of sets in $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$, $B \in \sigma(\mathcal{A})$.
    
5. Since $A \subseteq B_n$ for every $n$, it follows that $A \subseteq B$.
    
6. By **Monotonicity**, $\nu^*(A) \leq \nu^*(B)$. Also, for every $n$, $B \subseteq B_n$, so:
    
    $$\nu^*(B) \leq \nu^*(B_n) \leq \nu^*(A) + \frac{1}{n}$$
    
7. Since $\nu^*(B) \leq \nu^*(A) + \frac{1}{n}$ for all $n > 0$, we must have $\nu^*(B) \leq \nu^*(A)$.
    
8. Thus, $\nu^*(A) = \nu^*(B)$.

## Question

Consider a measure space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$. If $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^\infty \subset \mathcal{F}$ is a sequence of measurable sets, we define:

$$\limsup_{i \to \infty} E_i = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{i \geq n} E_i \quad \text{and} \quad \liminf_{i \to \infty} E_i = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \bigcap_{i \geq n} E_i$$

- **(a)** Prove the logical characterization of these sets:
    
    - $\limsup E_i = \{\omega \in \Omega \mid \omega \in E_i \text{ for infinitely many } i\}$
        
    - $\liminf E_i = \{\omega \in \Omega \mid \omega \in E_i \text{ for all but finitely many } i\}$
        
- **(b)** Determine the relationship between the indicator function $\chi_{\limsup E_i}$ and $\limsup_{i \to \infty} \chi_{E_i}$. Ask a similar question regarding the $\liminf$.
    
- **(c)** Let $\{E_i\} \subset \mathcal{F}$ such that $\sum_{i \geq 1} \mu(E_i) < \infty$. Prove that:
    
    $$\mu(\{\omega \in \Omega \mid \omega \in E_i \text{ for infinitely many } i\}) = 0$$
    
    This result is known as the **Borel–Cantelli Lemma**.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

From **Folland, G. B. (Real Analysis)** and **De Barra, G. (Measure Theory and Integration)**:

1. **Indicator Function ($\chi_E$):** The function $\chi_E(\omega)$ is defined as $1$ if $\omega \in E$ and $0$ if $\omega \notin E$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ It acts as a switch that "turns on" only when a point belongs to the set $E$.
        
2. **Countable Subadditivity:** For any sequence of sets $\{A_i\}$, $\mu(\bigcup A_i) \leq \sum \mu(A_i)$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ The area of a combined shape is at most the sum of the areas of its individual parts, accounting for potential overlaps.
        
3. **Continuity of Measure (From Above):** If $A_1 \supseteq A_2 \supseteq \dots$ are measurable sets and $\mu(A_1) < \infty$, then $\mu(\bigcap A_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(A_n)$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ If you have a shrinking sequence of sets, the limit of their "sizes" is equal to the "size" of their ultimate intersection.
        
4. **Convergence of Series:** If a series of non-negative numbers $\sum a_i$ converges, then the "tails" of the series must go to zero: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=n}^\infty a_i = 0$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ If the total sum is finite, the amount of "mass" left in the infinite end of the sequence must vanish as you move further out.

## Solution

### Part (a): Logical Characterization

**Step 1: Prove the $\limsup$ characterization.**

- Let $A = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{i \geq n} E_i$.
    
- If $\omega \in A$, then for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\omega$ must be in the union $\bigcup_{i \geq n} E_i$. This means for every $n$, there is at least one index $i \geq n$ such that $\omega \in E_i$. This implies $\omega$ occurs in the sequence $E_i$ at arbitrarily large indices (infinitely often).
    
- Conversely, if $\omega$ is in infinitely many $E_i$, then no matter how large an $n$ we pick, we can always find an index $i \geq n$ where $\omega \in E_i$. Thus, $\omega \in \bigcup_{i \geq n} E_i$ for all $n$, so $\omega$ is in the intersection.
    

**Step 2: Prove the $\liminf$ characterization.**

- Let $B = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \bigcap_{i \geq n} E_i$.
    
- If $\omega \in B$, then there exists _some_ $n$ such that $\omega \in \bigcap_{i \geq n} E_i$. This means $\omega \in E_i$ for every single $i \geq n$. The only indices where $\omega$ might _not_ be in $E_i$ are the finite number of indices $\{1, 2, \dots, n-1\}$. Thus, it is in all but finitely many sets.
    
- Conversely, if $\omega \in E_i$ for all $i$ except for a finite set of indices, let $n-1$ be the maximum index in that finite set. Then for all $i \geq n$, $\omega \in E_i$, which places $\omega$ in the intersection $\bigcap_{i \geq n} E_i$ and consequently in the union $B$.
    

### Part (b): Indicator Functions

**Step 1: Compare $\chi_{\limsup E_i}$ and $\limsup \chi_{E_i}$.**

- $\chi_{\limsup E_i}(\omega) = 1$ if and only if $\omega \in E_i$ for infinitely many $i$.
    
- $\limsup_{i \to \infty} \chi_{E_i}(\omega)$ is the limit superior of a sequence of 0s and 1s. This value is $1$ if the sequence $\chi_{E_i}(\omega)$ is $1$ infinitely often, and $0$ otherwise.
    
- Therefore, **$\chi_{\limsup E_i} = \limsup_{i \to \infty} \chi_{E_i}$**.
    

**Step 2: Compare $\chi_{\liminf E_i}$ and $\liminf \chi_{E_i}$.**

- $\chi_{\liminf E_i}(\omega) = 1$ if and only if $\omega \in E_i$ for all $i \geq n$ (for some $n$).
    
- $\liminf_{i \to \infty} \chi_{E_i}(\omega)$ is $1$ if and only if the sequence of 0s and 1s is eventually all 1s (i.e., it is $0$ only finitely many times).
    
- Therefore, **$\chi_{\liminf E_i} = \liminf_{i \to \infty} \chi_{E_i}$**.
    

### Part (c): Borel–Cantelli Lemma

**Step 1: Set up the inequality using the $\limsup$ definition.**

- From Part (a), the set of points in infinitely many $E_i$ is $L = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{i \geq n} E_i$.
    
- Let $G_n = \bigcup_{i=n}^\infty E_i$. Note that $G_1 \supseteq G_2 \supseteq G_3 \dots$ is a nested shrinking sequence of sets.
    

**Step 2: Apply Countable Subadditivity to $G_n$.**

- By the **definition of measure** and **Countable Subadditivity**:
    
    $$\mu(G_n) = \mu\left(\bigcup_{i=n}^\infty E_i\right) \leq \sum_{i=n}^\infty \mu(E_i)$$
    

**Step 3: Use the convergence of the sum.**

- We are given that $\sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(E_i) < \infty$.
    
- By the **properties of convergent series**, the tail of the sum must vanish: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=n}^\infty \mu(E_i) = 0$.
    
- Since $0 \leq \mu(G_n) \leq \sum_{i=n}^\infty \mu(E_i)$, by the Squeeze Theorem, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(G_n) = 0$.
    

**Step 4: Use Continuity of Measure.**

- Because $\mu(G_1) \leq \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(E_i) < \infty$, the conditions for **Continuity of Measure from Above** are met.
    
- Therefore, $\mu(L) = \mu(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty G_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(G_n)$.
    
- Since we showed this limit is $0$, we conclude $\mu(L) = 0$.

## Question

If $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a countable set, then prove that $\lambda(E) = 0$, where $\lambda$ denotes the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

From **Folland, G. B. (Real Analysis)** and **De Barra, G. (Measure Theory and Integration)**:

1. **Countable Set:** A set $E$ is countable if there exists a bijection between $E$ and a subset of the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ This means the elements of the set can be listed in a sequence: $x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots$
        
2. **Lebesgue Measure of a Singleton:** For any single point $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $\lambda(\{x\}) = 0$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ A single point has zero length.
        
3. **Countable Additivity:** If $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of disjoint measurable sets, then $\mu(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty E_i) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(E_i)$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ The total size of a collection of non-overlapping pieces is exactly the sum of the sizes of each piece.
        

---

## Solution

**Step 1: Enumerate the set.**

Since $E$ is a countable set, by the definition of countability, we can list its elements as a sequence. We write $E = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots\}$.

**Step 2: Express the set as a union of singletons.**

We can represent the set $E$ as the countable union of its individual points:

$$E = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty \{x_i\}$$

Note that these singleton sets $\{x_i\}$ are disjoint because each contains exactly one distinct element of $E$.

**Step 3: Apply the property of countable additivity.**

By the property of **Countable Additivity** for measures, the measure of a countable union of disjoint sets is the sum of their individual measures. Therefore:

$$\lambda(E) = \lambda\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty \{x_i\}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \lambda(\{x_i\})$$

**Step 4: Use the measure of a singleton.**

By the **definition of Lebesgue measure** (or the property that the measure of any interval $[a, a]$ is $a - a = 0$), we know that for any $i$:

$$\lambda(\{x_i\}) = 0$$

**Step 5: Calculate the final sum.**

Substituting the value from Step 4 into our equation from Step 3, we get:

$$\lambda(E) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty 0 = 0$$

**Conclusion:**

Thus, we have proved that the Lebesgue measure of any countable set $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ is zero.

Let $D = \{d_1, d_2, \dots\}$ be a countable dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Define the set $G$ as a countable union of open intervals:

$$G = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \left(d_n - \frac{1}{n^2}, d_n + \frac{1}{n^2}\right)$$

Prove that for every closed set $F \subset \mathbb{R}$, the Lebesgue measure of their symmetric difference is strictly positive:

$$\lambda(G \Delta F) > 0$$

where $G \Delta F = (G \setminus F) \cup (F \setminus G)$.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

From **Folland, G. B. (Real Analysis)** and **De Barra, G. (Measure Theory and Integration)**:

1. **Dense Set:** A set $D$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ if every non-empty open interval $(a, b)$ contains at least one element of $D$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ A dense set is "everywhere" in the sense that you cannot find any "gap" in the real line that doesn't contain a point from $D$.
        
2. **Symmetric Difference ($\Delta$):** $G \Delta F$ consists of points that are in $G$ or $F$, but not in both.
    
    - _Intuition:_ If $\lambda(G \Delta F) = 0$, it means $G$ and $F$ are "essentially" the same set, differing only by a set of measure zero.
        
3. **Countable Subadditivity:** For any sequence of sets $\{E_n\}$, $\lambda(\bigcup E_n) \leq \sum \lambda(E_n)$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ The total length of a union of intervals is at most the sum of their individual lengths.
        
4. **Density of Open/Closed Sets:** If a closed set $F$ contains a dense set $D$, then $F$ must be the entire space ($F = \mathbb{R}$).
    
    - _Intuition:_ Because $F$ is closed, it contains all its limit points; if $D$ is dense, its limit points cover the whole real line.
        

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Step 1: Analyze the measure of $G$

We first show that $G$ is not the entire real line by calculating an upper bound for its measure. By the **definition of $G$** and **Countable Subadditivity**:

$$\lambda(G) = \lambda\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \left(d_n - \frac{1}{n^2}, d_n + \frac{1}{n^2}\right)\right) \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda\left(d_n - \frac{1}{n^2}, d_n + \frac{1}{n^2}\right)$$

The length of each interval is $(d_n + \frac{1}{n^2}) - (d_n - \frac{1}{n^2}) = \frac{2}{n^2}$. Thus:

$$\lambda(G) \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2}{n^2} = 2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = 2\left(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\right) = \frac{\pi^2}{3}$$

Since $\lambda(G)$ is finite, $G$ cannot be equal to $\mathbb{R}$ (which has infinite measure).

### Step 2: Assume for contradiction

Suppose there exists a closed set $F$ such that $\lambda(G \Delta F) = 0$. This would mean that $G$ and $F$ are equal almost everywhere. Specifically, this implies $\lambda(G \setminus F) = 0$ and $\lambda(F \setminus G) = 0$.

### Step 3: Analyze the relationship between $D$ and $F$

By **definition**, $G = \bigcup I_n$, where each $I_n$ is an open interval centered at $d_n$. Since each $I_n$ has positive measure ($\frac{2}{n^2} > 0$), and we assumed $\lambda(G \setminus F) = 0$, it must be that $F$ "covers" a significant portion of every $I_n$.

Crucially, if $F$ is a closed set and $\lambda(G \setminus F) = 0$, then $G \subseteq F$ must be true in a topological sense. If there were a point $d_n \in D$ such that $d_n \notin F$, then since $F^c$ is open, there would be an entire interval around $d_n$ completely missing from $F$. This would force $\lambda(G \setminus F) > 0$. Therefore, to maintain $\lambda(G \Delta F) = 0$, the closed set $F$ must contain the dense set $D$.

### Step 4: Reach the contradiction

By the **property of dense sets**, if a closed set $F$ contains a dense set $D$, then $F = \mathbb{R}$.

However, if $F = \mathbb{R}$, then:

$$G \Delta F = G \Delta \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R} \setminus G$$

The measure of this difference is $\lambda(\mathbb{R} \setminus G) = \lambda(\mathbb{R}) - \lambda(G) = \infty - \text{finite} = \infty$.

This directly contradicts our assumption in Step 2 that $\lambda(G \Delta F) = 0$.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Since the assumption that $\lambda(G \Delta F) = 0$ leads to a contradiction for any closed set $F$, we must conclude that:

$$\lambda(G \Delta F) > 0$$

## Definitions and Theorems Used

From **Folland, G. B. (Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications)**:

1. **Lebesgue-Stieltjes Outer Measure:** For a nondecreasing right-continuous function $F$, the outer measure $\lambda_F^*$ of a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is defined as:
    
    $$\lambda_F^*(E) = \inf \left\{ \sum_{j=1}^\infty [F(b_j) - F(a_j)] : E \subseteq \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty (a_j, b_j] \right\}$$

2. **Measure of a Half-Open Interval:** For any $a < b$, the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure of the interval $(a, b]$ is given by $\lambda_F((a, b]) = F(b) - F(a)$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ The size of an interval is determined by how much the function $F$ "climbs" between the start and end points.
        
3. **Carathéodory’s Theorem:** A set $E$ is $\lambda_F^*$-measurable if for every test set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$:
    
    $$\lambda_F^*(A) = \lambda_F^*(A \cap E) + \lambda_F^*(A \cap E^c)$$
    
    - _Intuition:_ A set is measurable if it splits any other set in an additive way regarding its measure.
        

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Step 1: Analyze the values of the outer measure for single points

Let's determine the measure of a single point $\{x\}$.

- If $x \neq 0$: We can cover $\{x\}$ with the interval $(x-\epsilon, x]$. For any $x > 0$, $F(x) = 1$ and $F(x-\epsilon) = 1$ (for small $\epsilon$), so $F(x) - F(x-\epsilon) = 0$. For any $x < 0$, $F(x) = 0$ and $F(x-\epsilon) = 0$, so the difference is also $0$. Thus, $\lambda_F^*(\{x\}) = 0$ for all $x \neq 0$.
    
- If $x = 0$: We cover $\{0\}$ with $(-\epsilon, 0]$. Here, $F(0) = 1$ and $F(-\epsilon) = 0$. The difference is $1 - 0 = 1$. As $\epsilon \to 0$, this value remains $1$. Thus, $\lambda_F^*(\{0\}) = 1$.
    

### Step 2: Define $\lambda_F^*$ explicitly for any set $E$

By the **definition of Lebesgue-Stieltjes outer measure** and the results in Step 1:

- If $0 \in E$, then $E$ contains a point with measure $1$. Any cover of $E$ must cover $\{0\}$, so the sum of the jumps will be at least $1$.
    
- If $0 \notin E$, every point in $E$ has a local "jump" of $0$.
    
    Therefore, the outer measure is:
    
    $$\lambda_F^*(E) = \begin{cases} 1, & 0 \in E \\ 0, & 0 \notin E \end{cases}$$
    
    This is essentially the **Dirac measure** centered at $0$.
    

### Step 3: Determine the measurable sets $\mathcal{M}_F$

We apply the **Carathéodory criterion**. For any set $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ to be measurable, it must satisfy $\lambda_F^*(A) = \lambda_F^*(A \cap E) + \lambda_F^*(A \cap E^c)$ for every test set $A$.

- **Case 1: $0 \in A$.** Then $\lambda_F^*(A) = 1$.
    
    - If $0 \in E$, then $0 \in (A \cap E)$ and $0 \notin (A \cap E^c)$. The right side is $\lambda_F^*(A \cap E) + \lambda_F^*(A \cap E^c) = 1 + 0 = 1$.
        
    - If $0 \notin E$, then $0 \notin (A \cap E)$ and $0 \in (A \cap E^c)$. The right side is $\lambda_F^*(A \cap E) + \lambda_F^*(A \cap E^c) = 0 + 1 = 1$.
        
- **Case 2: $0 \notin A$.** Then $\lambda_F^*(A) = 0$.
    
    - Since $0 \notin A$, $0$ cannot be in $(A \cap E)$ or $(A \cap E^c)$. Thus, both terms on the right are $0$, and $0 = 0 + 0$.
        

### Step 4: Final Conclusion

Since the Carathéodory equation holds for **every** set $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ regardless of the test set $A$, every subset of the real numbers is measurable.

- **Outer Measure:** $\lambda_F^*(E) = \chi_E(0)$ (1 if $0 \in E$, 0 otherwise).
    
- **$\sigma$-algebra:** $\mathcal{M}_F = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ (the power set of $\mathbb{R}$).

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Part (a), (b), and (c): Measurability

**Step 1: Define continuous transformations.**

Consider the following three functions $f_1, f_2, f_3: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$:

- $f_1(x) = x - x_0$ (Translation)
    
- $f_2(x) = -x$ (Reflection)
    
- $f_3(x) = \frac{x}{x_0}$ (Scaling, where $x_0 \neq 0$)
    

All three are continuous functions.

**Step 2: Use the property of continuous preimages.**

Recall that if $f$ is continuous, then $f^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$ for any $A \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$. Note the following:

- $A + x_0 = f_1^{-1}(A)$ because $x \in f_1^{-1}(A) \iff x - x_0 \in A \iff x \in A + x_0$.
    
- $-A = f_2^{-1}(A)$ because $x \in f_2^{-1}(A) \iff -x \in A \iff x \in -A$.
    
- $x_0 A = f_3^{-1}(A)$ because $x \in f_3^{-1}(A) \iff \frac{x}{x_0} \in A \iff x \in x_0 A$.
    

Since $A$ is a Borel set and the functions are continuous, their preimages—which are exactly the sets in question—are all Borel sets.

---

### Part (d): Invariance and Scaling

**Step 1: Prove Translation Invariance.**

Define a new measure $\mu$ by $\mu(E) = \lambda(E + x_0)$ for any Borel set $E$.

- Check $\mu$ on an interval $I = (a, b]$.
    
- $I + x_0 = (a + x_0, b + x_0]$.
    
- By the **definition of Lebesgue measure**, $\lambda(I + x_0) = (b + x_0) - (a + x_0) = b - a = \lambda(I)$.
    
- Since $\mu(I) = \lambda(I)$ for all intervals, by the **Uniqueness of Lebesgue Measure**, $\mu(E) = \lambda(E)$ for all Borel sets. Thus, $\lambda(A + x_0) = \lambda(A)$.
    

**Step 2: Prove Scaling Property.**

Define another measure $\nu$ by $\nu(E) = \lambda(x_0 E)$. We first assume $x_0 > 0$.

- Check $\nu$ on an interval $I = (a, b]$.
    
- $x_0 I = (x_0 a, x_0 b]$.
    
- By the **definition of Lebesgue measure**, $\lambda(x_0 I) = x_0 b - x_0 a = x_0(b - a) = x_0 \lambda(I)$.
    
- Since $\nu(I) = x_0 \lambda(I)$ for all intervals, the measures $\nu$ and $x_0 \lambda$ must be the same on all Borel sets. Thus, $\lambda(x_0 A) = x_0 \lambda(A)$ for $x_0 > 0$.
    

**Step 3: Handle the negative case.**

If $x_0 < 0$, then $x_0 I = [x_0 b, x_0 a)$. The length is $x_0 a - x_0 b = -x_0(b - a) = |x_0|\lambda(I)$.

By applying the same uniqueness argument, we conclude $\lambda(x_0 A) = |x_0|\lambda(A)$ for any $x_0 \neq 0$.

1. **Translation Invariance:** A measure $\mu$ is translation-invariant if shifting a set by any value $x$ does not change its measure.

2. **Borel $\sigma$-algebra ($\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$):** The $\sigma$-algebra generated by all open intervals (or equivalently, all half-open intervals $(a, b]$).

3. **Uniqueness of Lebesgue Measure:** If $\mu$ is a translation-invariant measure on $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$ that is finite on compact sets, then there exists a constant $c \geq 0$ such that $\mu = c\lambda$.

    - _Intuition:_ The size of a whole made of non-overlapping parts is the sum of the sizes of those parts.
        

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Step 1: Establish the form of the measure

By the **Uniqueness of Lebesgue Measure** (Theorem 2.20 in Folland), any translation-invariant Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ that assigns finite measure to bounded sets must be a constant multiple of the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$. Therefore, there exists some constant $c \in [0, \infty)$ such that:

$$\mu(A) = c\lambda(A)$$

for all $A \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

### Step 2: Determine the constant $c$

We are given the specific value for the interval $[0, 1]$. By the **definition of $\mu$** established in Step 1:

$$\mu([0, 1]) = c\lambda([0, 1])$$

We know from the **definition of Lebesgue measure** that $\lambda([0, 1]) = 1 - 0 = 1$.

Substituting the given value $\mu([0, 1]) = 2$:

$$2 = c(1)$$

Thus, $c = 2$.

### Step 3: Verify the relationship for all sets

Since we have found $c = 2$, the relationship $\mu(A) = c\lambda(A)$ becomes:

$$\mu(A) = 2\lambda(A)$$

This must hold for all $A \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$ because the two measures agree on the generating set of intervals and are both translation-invariant.

### Step 4: Justification of Uniqueness (Alternative Perspective)

If one does not wish to cite the uniqueness theorem directly, we can see why this works by considering intervals of the form $[0, 1/n]$.

- By **Translation Invariance**, $\mu([0, 1/n]) = \mu([1/n, 2/n]) = \dots = \mu([(n-1)/n, 1])$.
    
- By **Countable Additivity**, the sum of these $n$ identical measures must equal $\mu([0, 1]) = 2$.
    
- Therefore, $n \cdot \mu([0, 1/n]) = 2$, which means $\mu([0, 1/n]) = 2/n = 2\lambda([0, 1/n])$.
    
- Since this holds for all rational-length intervals and $\mu$ is a measure, it extends to all Borel sets.
    

**Conclusion:**

$\mu = 2\lambda$.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Part 1: Proof for $\sigma$-finite spaces

**Step 1: Decompose the space.**

By the **definition of $\sigma$-finiteness**, we can write $\Omega = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \Omega_n$ where each $\mu(\Omega_n) < \infty$. Without loss of generality, we can assume the sets $\Omega_n$ are increasing ($\Omega_1 \subseteq \Omega_2 \subseteq \dots$).

**Step 2: Partition the collection $\{A_\alpha\}$ by measure size.**

For a fixed $n$ and a fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the set of indices:

$$\Lambda_{n,k} = \{ \alpha \in \Lambda : \mu(A_\alpha \cap \Omega_n) > \frac{1}{k} \}$$

This represents all sets in our collection that have a "substantial" chunk (greater than $1/k$) inside the finite-measure piece $\Omega_n$.

**Step 3: Show $\Lambda_{n,k}$ is finite.**

Suppose $\Lambda_{n,k}$ contained more than $m$ elements for some large $m$. Because the $A_\alpha$ are disjoint, the sets $\{A_\alpha \cap \Omega_n\}$ are also disjoint. By **countable additivity** (finite additivity):

$$\mu(\Omega_n) \geq \mu\left( \bigcup_{\alpha \in \Lambda_{n,k}} (A_\alpha \cap \Omega_n) \right) = \sum_{\alpha \in \Lambda_{n,k}} \mu(A_\alpha \cap \Omega_n) > \frac{m}{k}$$

If $m$ is too large, this sum would exceed $\mu(\Omega_n)$. Since $\mu(\Omega_n)$ is finite, $m$ must be bounded. Thus, $\Lambda_{n,k}$ must be a **finite set** for every $n$ and $k$.

**Step 4: Use the property of countable unions.**

The set of all indices $\alpha$ such that $\mu(A_\alpha \cap \Omega_n) > 0$ is $\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \Lambda_{n,k}$, which is a countable union of finite sets, and therefore **countable**.

Finally, the set $\Lambda$ is the collection of all $\alpha$ such that $\mu(A_\alpha) > 0$. Since $A_\alpha = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty (A_\alpha \cap \Omega_n)$, if $\mu(A_\alpha) > 0$, then there must exist some $n$ such that $\mu(A_\alpha \cap \Omega_n) > 0$.

Thus, $\Lambda = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \Lambda_{n,k}$. As a countable union of countable sets, **$\Lambda$ is countable**.

---

### Part 2: Counterexample for non-$\sigma$-finite spaces

**Step 1: Choose a non-$\sigma$-finite space.**

Let $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ and let $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$. Let $\mu$ be the **counting measure**.

In this space, $\mu(A) = \infty$ if $A$ is infinite. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, it cannot be written as a countable union of finite sets. Thus, this space is **not $\sigma$-finite**.

**Step 2: Define a disjoint collection.**

Consider the collection of singleton sets:

$$\{A_x\}_{x \in \mathbb{R}} = \{ \{x\} : x \in \mathbb{R} \}$$

- These sets are clearly disjoint.
    
- For the counting measure, $\mu(\{x\}) = 1$ for every $x$, so every set has **positive measure**.
    

**Step 3: Show $\Lambda$ is uncountable.**

In this case, the index set $\Lambda$ is the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.

As $\mathbb{R}$ is an uncountable set, we have found an example where a disjoint collection of positive-measure sets is uncountable, proving $\sigma$-finiteness was a necessary hypothesis.

4. **Lebesgue-Stieltjes Measure ($\lambda_F$):** A measure induced by a non-decreasing, right-continuous function $F$, where $\lambda_F((a, b]) = F(b) - F(a)$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ This measure weights different parts of the real line differently based on how fast $F$ grows.
        

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Part (a): $E^c$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$

**Step 1: Use the definition of density.**

To show $E^c$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, we must show that for any open interval $(a, b)$ with $a < b$, the intersection $E^c \cap (a, b)$ is non-empty.

**Step 2: Assume for contradiction.**

Suppose $E^c$ is **not** dense. This implies there exists some open interval $I = (a, b)$ such that $E^c \cap I = \emptyset$.

**Step 3: Relate the interval to $E$.**

If $E^c \cap I$ is empty, it means that every point in the interval $I$ must belong to $E$. Therefore, $I \subseteq E$.

**Step 4: Apply Monotonicity.**

By the **Monotonicity of outer measure**, if $I \subseteq E$, then:

$$\lambda^*(I) \leq \lambda^*(E)$$

We are given that $\lambda^*(E) = 0$. This implies $\lambda^*(I) = 0$.

**Step 5: Reach the contradiction.**

According to the **Measure of an Interval**, the measure of $I = (a, b)$ is $b - a$. Since $a < b$, we know $b - a > 0$.

This contradicts Step 4, where we found the measure must be $0$. Thus, our assumption was false, and $E^c$ must be dense.

---

### Part (b): Is this true for $\lambda_F$?

**Step 1: Identify the condition for a counterexample.**

The conclusion in Part (a) relied on the fact that any interval $(a, b)$ has strictly positive Lebesgue measure. For a general Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $\lambda_F$, this is not always true. If $\lambda_F(I) = 0$, then $E$ could contain $I$ without violating the $\lambda_F^*(E) = 0$ condition.

**Step 2: Construct a counterexample.**

Consider a constant function $F(x) = c$. In this case, for any interval $(a, b]$, $\lambda_F((a, b]) = F(b) - F(a) = c - c = 0$.

- Let $E = \mathbb{R}$.
    
- Then $\lambda_F^*(E) = 0$ because the measure of the entire line is zero.
    
- However, $E^c = \emptyset$, which is **not dense** in $\mathbb{R}$.
    

**Step 3: Provide a more specific counterexample.**

Consider $F(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x < 0 \\ 0 & 0 \leq x < 1 \\ 1 & x \geq 1 \end{cases}$ (a step function).

The measure $\lambda_F$ is a point mass at $x=1$. Let $E = (-\infty, 0.5)$.

- $\lambda_F^*(E) = 0$ because $E$ does not contain the point $x=1$.
    
- But $E^c = [0.5, \infty)$, which is missing the entire interval $(-\infty, 0.5)$. Thus, $E^c$ is not dense.
    

**Conclusion:**

The statement is **false** for general Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures. It only holds if the measure $\lambda_F$ assigns strictly positive measure to every non-empty open interval (which happens if $F$ is strictly increasing).

    - _Intuition:_ Unlike the standard Lebesgue measure, these can have "jumps" (atoms) where a single point has a positive measure.
        

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Step 1: Define the auxiliary function

Following the hint, let $f_E: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by:

$$f_E(x) = \lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x])$$

Since $E \cap (-\infty, x]$ is always a subset of $E$, and $\lambda(E) < \infty$, the function $f_E$ is well-defined and finite for all $x$.

### Step 2: Prove that $f_E$ is continuous

To use the Intermediate Value Theorem, we must show $f_E$ is continuous.

- **Right-continuity:** As $y \to x$ from the right ($y > x$), the sets $(E \cap (-\infty, y])$ shrink toward $(E \cap (-\infty, x])$. By **Continuity of Measure from Above**, the measures converge.
    
- **Left-continuity:** As $y \to x$ from the left ($y < x$), the sets $(E \cap (-\infty, y])$ expand toward $E \cap (-\infty, x)$. By **Continuity of Measure from Below**, $\lim_{y \to x^-} f_E(y) = \lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x))$.
    
- Since the Lebesgue measure of a single point is zero ($\lambda(\{x\}) = 0$), we have:
    
    $$\lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x]) = \lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x)) + \lambda(E \cap \{x\}) = \lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x))$$
    
    Therefore, the left limit equals the right limit, and $f_E$ is continuous.
    

### Step 3: Evaluate the limits of $f_E$

- As $x \to -\infty$, the set $E \cap (-\infty, x]$ approaches the empty set. By **Continuity of Measure**, $\lim_{x \to -\infty} f_E(x) = \lambda(\emptyset) = 0$.
    
- As $x \to \infty$, the set $E \cap (-\infty, x]$ approaches $E$. By **Continuity of Measure**, $\lim_{x \to \infty} f_E(x) = \lambda(E)$.

### Step 4: Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem

We are given $\alpha \in (0, 1)$, so $0 < \alpha\lambda(E) < \lambda(E)$.

Since $f_E$ is continuous and spans the range $(0, \lambda(E))$, by the **Intermediate Value Theorem**, there must exist some $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that:

$$f_E(x_0) = \alpha\lambda(E)$$

### Step 5: Define the set $E_\alpha$

Let $E_\alpha = E \cap (-\infty, x_0]$.

- By the **definition of measurable sets**, $E_\alpha$ is measurable because it is the intersection of two measurable sets.
    
- By construction, $E_\alpha \subset E$.
    
- By Step 4, $\lambda(E_\alpha) = f_E(x_0) = \alpha\lambda(E)$.
    
    This completes the proof for the Lebesgue measure.
    

---

### Step 6: Analyze the result for $\lambda_F$

The result is **false** for a general Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure.

- **Counterexample:** Consider the function $F(x) = 0$ for $x < 0$ and $F(x) = 1$ for $x \geq 0$. This induces a measure $\lambda_F$ that is a point mass at $0$ (i.e., $\lambda_F(\{0\}) = 1$ and all other sets not containing $0$ have measure $0$).
    
- Let $E = \{0\}$. Then $\lambda_F(E) = 1$.
    
- Choose $\alpha = 0.5$. We need a subset $E_\alpha \subset \{0\}$ such that $\lambda_F(E_\alpha) = 0.5$.
    
- The only subsets of $\{0\}$ are $\emptyset$ (measure $0$) and $\{0\}$ (measure $1$).
    
- Since neither has measure $0.5$, the result fails.
    

**Conclusion:** The result holds for Lebesgue measure because it is "atomless," but fails for $\lambda_F$ if the measure has atoms (discontinuities in $F$).

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Solution

**Step 1: Define a set-valued function.**

Similar to the case for finite measure, we define a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to [0, \infty]$ that tracks how much of $E$ is captured as we "sweep" across the real line from left to right:

$$f(x) = \lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x])$$

**Step 2: Prove that $f$ is continuous.**

We check the limits from both sides at any point $x_0$:

- **From the left:** As $x \to x_0^-$, the sets $E \cap (-\infty, x]$ increase to $E \cap (-\infty, x_0)$. By **Continuity of Measure from Below**, $\lim_{x \to x_0^-} f(x) = \lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x_0))$.
    
- **From the right:** Since we are looking for a finite $\alpha$, we can restrict our attention to a range where the measure is finite. For any $x > x_0$, $\lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x])$ is finite if we pick $x$ small enough. By **Continuity of Measure from Above**, the limit from the right is $f(x_0)$.
    
- Because $\lambda(\{x_0\}) = 0$, there is no difference between $\lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x_0))$ and $\lambda(E \cap (-\infty, x_0])$.
    
    Thus, $f(x)$ is a continuous function.
    

**Step 3: Evaluate the range of $f$.**

- As $x \to -\infty$, $E \cap (-\infty, x] \to \emptyset$, so $\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = 0$.
    
- As $x \to \infty$, $E \cap (-\infty, x] \to E$. By **Continuity of Measure from Below**, $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \lambda(E) = \infty$.
    

**Step 4: Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem.**

The function $f$ is continuous and maps the real line onto the interval $[0, \infty)$.

For any $\alpha \in [0, \infty)$, the value $\alpha$ lies within the range of $f$ (specifically between $0$ and $\infty$).

By the **Intermediate Value Theorem**, there must exist at least one $x_\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_\alpha) = \alpha$.

**Step 5: Define the subset $E_\alpha$.**

Let $E_\alpha = E \cap (-\infty, x_\alpha]$.

1. **Measurability:** Since $E$ is measurable and $(-\infty, x_\alpha]$ is a Borel set (and thus Lebesgue measurable), their intersection $E_\alpha$ is measurable.
    
2. **Inclusion:** By the definition of intersection, $E_\alpha \subset E$.
    
3. **Measure:** By Step 4, $\lambda(E_\alpha) = f(x_\alpha) = \alpha$.
    

This completes the proof.

From **Folland, G. B. (Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications)** and **De Barra, G. (Measure Theory and Integration)**:

1. **Lebesgue Measurable Function:** A function $f$ is measurable if the preimage of every Borel set is a Lebesgue measurable set. Specifically, for any $M \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : |f(x)| \leq M\}$ must be in $\mathcal{L}$.

    - _Intuition:_ As you expand a set, its measure grows toward the measure of its ultimate limit.
        
4. **Bounded Function on a Set:** A function $f$ is bounded on a set $E$ if there exists a finite constant $M$ such that $|f(x)| \leq M$ for all $x \in E$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ The function doesn't "blow up" to infinity within that specific region.
        

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Solution

**Step 1: Define a sequence of sets based on the function's values.**

For each natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, define the set $E_n$ as the region where the absolute value of $f$ is at most $n$:

$$E_n = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : |f(x)| \leq n\}$$

By the **definition of a measurable function**, each $E_n$ is a Lebesgue measurable set.

**Step 2: Show that these sets cover the domain.**

Since the codomain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$ (the real numbers), every output $f(x)$ is a finite real number. Therefore, for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there must exist some integer $n$ such that $|f(x)| \leq n$. This implies:

$$\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n = \mathbb{R}$$

**Step 3: Analyze the measure of the union.**

By the **properties of Lebesgue measure**, we know the measure of the entire real line is infinite:

$$\lambda\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n\right) = \lambda(\mathbb{R}) = \infty$$

**Step 4: Use Continuity of Measure.**

Note that the sets are nested: $E_1 \subset E_2 \subset E_3 \dots$ because if $|f(x)| \leq n$, then $|f(x)| \leq n+1$. By **Continuity of Measure from Below**, we have:

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \lambda(E_n) = \lambda(\mathbb{R}) = \infty$$

**Step 5: Conclude the existence of a set with positive measure.**

If the limit of $\lambda(E_n)$ is infinity, there must exist some index $N$ such that $\lambda(E_N)$ is large. Specifically, there must be an $N$ such that $\lambda(E_N) > 0$.

(In fact, there is an $N$ such that $\lambda(E_N) > 1,000,000$, but we only need it to be strictly positive).

**Step 6: Final Verification.**

Let $E = E_N$.

1. By Step 5, $\lambda(E) > 0$.
    
2. By the **definition of $E_N$**, for all $x \in E$, $|f(x)| \leq N$.
    
3. Thus, $f$ is bounded on $E$ by the constant $N$.
    

This proves that there exists a set of positive Lebesgue measure on which $f$ is bounded.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Solution

**Step 1: Construct a non-measurable set.**

Following the standard construction by Giuseppe Vitali, let $V \subset [0, 1]$ be a **non-measurable set**. We know such a set exists under the Axiom of Choice. Because $V$ is not a Lebesgue measurable set, its indicator function $\chi_V$ is not a measurable function.

**Step 2: Define the function $f$.**

We want to define $f$ such that it "hides" its non-measurability within its sign, but disappears when we take the absolute value. Define $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ as follows:

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \in V \\ -1 & \text{if } x \notin V \end{cases}$$

Alternatively, this can be written using indicator functions as $f(x) = \chi_V(x) - \chi_{V^c}(x)$.

**Step 3: Show that $f$ is not measurable.**

Consider the Borel set $B = \{1\}$. By the **definition of measurable function**, the preimage $f^{-1}(B)$ must be a measurable set.

- $f^{-1}(\{1\}) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : f(x) = 1\} = V$.
    
- Since $V$ is a **non-measurable set**, its preimage is not in $\mathcal{L}$.
    
    Therefore, $f$ is not a Lebesgue measurable function.
    

**Step 4: Show that $|f|$ is measurable.**

Now, let's examine the absolute value $|f(x)|$.

- If $x \in V$, $|f(x)| = |1| = 1$.
    
- If $x \notin V$, $|f(x)| = |-1| = 1$.
    
    Thus, $|f(x)| = 1$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. In other words, $|f|$ is a constant function.
    

**Step 5: Verify the measurability of the constant function.**

A constant function is always measurable. To see this, let $B$ be any Borel set.

- If $1 \in B$, then $|f|^{-1}(B) = \mathbb{R}$ (which is measurable).
    
- If $1 \notin B$, then $|f|^{-1}(B) = \emptyset$ (which is measurable).
    
    Since $\mathbb{R}$ and $\emptyset$ are both in $\mathcal{L}$, $|f|$ is a Lebesgue measurable function.
    

**Conclusion:**

The function $f$ defined by the non-measurable set $V$ serves as the required example: $|f|$ is constant (measurable), but $f$ maps to a non-measurable set (not measurable).

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Solution

**Step 1: Simplify the problem using the definition of measurability.**

To prove that $f$ is Borel measurable, we need to show that for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $E_a = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : f(x) > a\}$ is a Borel set. We will assume $f$ is non-decreasing for this proof. The proof for a non-increasing function is entirely analogous.

**Step 2: Characterize the set $E_a$.**

Suppose $f$ is non-decreasing. If $x \in E_a$, then $f(x) > a$.

Because $f$ is non-decreasing, for any $y > x$, we must have $f(y) \geq f(x) > a$. This implies that if a point $x$ is in $E_a$, every point to its right is also in $E_a$.

**Step 3: Identify the geometric form of $E_a$.**

Based on Step 2, $E_a$ must be an interval that extends to $+\infty$. Specifically, let $s = \inf \{x \in \mathbb{R} : f(x) > a\}$.

- If the set $\{x \in \mathbb{R} : f(x) > a\}$ is empty, then $E_a = \emptyset$.
    
- If the set is all of $\mathbb{R}$, then $E_a = (-\infty, \infty)$.
    
- Otherwise, $E_a$ will take one of two forms: $(s, \infty)$ or $[s, \infty)$.
    

**Step 4: Verify the Borel property of $E_a$.**

We have identified that $E_a$ is either an empty set, the whole real line, or an interval of the form $(s, \infty)$ or $[s, \infty)$.

By the **definition of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra**, every interval (whether open, closed, or half-open) is a Borel set.

- $\emptyset \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$
    
- $\mathbb{R} \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$
    
- $(s, \infty) \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$
    
- $[s, \infty) \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$
    

**Step 5: Apply the definition of a measurable function.**

Since we have shown that for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $f^{-1}((a, \infty))$ is an interval, and all intervals are Borel sets, the function satisfies the requirement for measurability.

**Conclusion:**

By the **criteria for Borel measurability**, since the preimage of every interval $(a, \infty)$ is a Borel set, $f$ is a Borel measurable function.

## Question

If $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable everywhere, then prove that its derivative $f'$ is Borel measurable.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

Based on **Folland, G. B. (Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications)** and **Rudin, W. (Real and Complex Analysis)**:

1. **Differentiability and Continuity:** If $f$ is differentiable at a point, it is continuous at that point. If $f$ is differentiable everywhere, it is a continuous function.
    
    - _Intuition:_ A differentiable function has no "jumps" or "breaks," meaning its graph is a solid, unbroken curve.
        
2. **Continuous Functions are Borel Measurable:** Every continuous function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is Borel measurable.
    
    - _Intuition:_ Continuity is a very strong property; it ensures that the preimage of any open set is open, which is the basic requirement for Borel measurability.
        
3. **Measurability of Limits:** If a sequence of measurable functions $\{f_n\}$ converges pointwise to a function $g$, then $g$ is also measurable.
    
    - _Intuition:_ Measurability is preserved under the process of taking limits; if the "building blocks" are measurable, their limit is too.
        
4. **Definition of the Derivative:** The derivative $f'(x)$ is defined as the limit of the difference quotient:
    
    $$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$
    
    - _Intuition:_ The derivative represents the instantaneous slope of the function at a specific point.
        

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Solution

**Step 1: Express the derivative as a discrete limit.**

By the **definition of the derivative**, we know that for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(x + \frac{1}{n}) - f(x)}{\frac{1}{n}}$$

We can define a sequence of functions $g_n(x)$ such that:

$$g_n(x) = n \left[ f\left(x + \frac{1}{n}\right) - f(x) \right]$$

Since the limit exists for all $x$ (because $f$ is differentiable everywhere), the sequence $\{g_n\}$ converges pointwise to $f'$.

**Step 2: Prove that each $g_n$ is measurable.**

Since $f$ is differentiable, it is a **continuous function**.

- The function $x \mapsto f(x + \frac{1}{n})$ is continuous because it is the composition of $f$ with a continuous translation.
    
- Each $g_n(x)$ is a linear combination of continuous functions ($f(x + 1/n)$ and $f(x)$).
    
- Therefore, each $g_n$ is continuous.
    
    By the theorem that **continuous functions are Borel measurable**, each function $g_n$ is Borel measurable.
    

**Step 3: Apply the limit property of measurable functions.**

We have a sequence of Borel measurable functions $\{g_n\}$ that converges pointwise to $f'$ at every point $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

By the theorem regarding the **measurability of limits**, the pointwise limit of a sequence of Borel measurable functions is itself Borel measurable.

**Step 4: Conclusion.**

Since $f'(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} g_n(x)$ and each $g_n$ is Borel measurable, it follows that $f'$ is Borel measurable.

1. **Measurable Function:** A function $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable if for every Borel set $B \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$, the preimage $f^{-1}(B)$ is an element of the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$.

4. **Composition of Preimages:** For any two functions $f$ and $g$, and any set $B$, the preimage of the composition satisfies $(g \circ f)^{-1}(B) = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(B))$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ To find the points that $g \circ f$ maps into $B$, you first find what $g$ maps into $B$, and then find what $f$ maps into those resulting points.
        

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Solution

**Step 1: Identify the goal.**

To prove that $h = g \circ f$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable, we must show that for any Borel set $B \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$, the set $h^{-1}(B)$ belongs to the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$.

**Step 2: Use the property of preimages of compositions.**

By the **definition of function composition**, the preimage of the set $B$ under $g \circ f$ is:

$$(g \circ f)^{-1}(B) = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(B))$$

**Step 3: Analyze the inner preimage $g^{-1}(B)$.**

Since $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a **continuous function**, it is a well-known result (Proposition 2.1 in Folland) that $g$ is Borel measurable.

By the **definition of Borel measurability**, the preimage of any Borel set $B$ under a Borel measurable function is itself a Borel set. Thus:

$$V = g^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$$

_Explanation:_ Continuity is actually a stronger condition than Borel measurability; since $g$ is continuous, the preimage of an open set is open (which is Borel), and the $\sigma$-algebra generated by these preimages must therefore be contained in $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$.

**Step 4: Analyze the outer preimage $f^{-1}(V)$.**

We are given that $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is **$\mathcal{F}$-measurable**.

From Step 3, we know that $V = g^{-1}(B)$ is a Borel set ($V \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$).

By the **definition of an $\mathcal{F}$-measurable function**, the preimage of any Borel set under $f$ must lie in $\mathcal{F}$. Therefore:

$$f^{-1}(V) \in \mathcal{F}$$

**Step 5: Conclusion.**

Combining the steps, we have shown that for any Borel set $B$:

$$(g \circ f)^{-1}(B) = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(B)) \in \mathcal{F}$$

By the **definition of a measurable function**, since the preimage of every Borel set is in $\mathcal{F}$, the composition $g \circ f$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable.

    - _Intuition:_ Rational numbers are "everywhere" on the real line; we can find a rational number as close to any real number as we want.
        

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Solution

**Step 1: Identify the criterion for measurability.**

By the **definition of a measurable function**, we must prove that $f^{-1}((a, \infty)) \in \mathcal{F}$ for every real number $a \in \mathbb{R}$. We are given that this property holds for all $r \in \mathbb{Q}$.

**Step 2: Relate real intervals to rational intervals.**

For any fixed real number $a$, consider an arbitrary $x \in \Omega$ such that $f(x) > a$. Because the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, there exists a rational number $r$ such that $f(x) > r > a$.

**Step 3: Express the real interval as a union of rational intervals.**

Based on the observation in Step 2, we can write the interval $(a, \infty)$ as the union of intervals $(r, \infty)$ for all rational numbers $r$ that are strictly greater than $a$:

$$(a, \infty) = \bigcup_{r \in \mathbb{Q}, r > a} (r, \infty) \text{}$$

**Step 4: Use the properties of preimages.**

Applying the preimage operator to both sides of the equation in Step 3, we get:

$$f^{-1}((a, \infty)) = f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{r \in \mathbb{Q}, r > a} (r, \infty)\right) = \bigcup_{r \in \mathbb{Q}, r > a} f^{-1}((r, \infty)) \text{}$$

**Step 5: Apply the $\sigma$-algebra axioms.**

We analyze the components of this union:

- By the **problem hypothesis**, each set $f^{-1}((r, \infty))$ is in the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ because $r$ is rational.
    
- The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. Therefore, the union $\bigcup_{r \in \mathbb{Q}, r > a}$ is a **countable union**.
    
- By the **definition of a $\sigma$-algebra**, $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under countable unions.
    

**Step 6: Conclusion.**

Since $f^{-1}((a, \infty))$ is a countable union of sets in $\mathcal{F}$, it follows that $f^{-1}((a, \infty)) \in \mathcal{F}$ for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Thus, by the **definition of a measurable function**, $f$ is $(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}})$-measurable.

## Question

Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a nonempty family of continuous real-valued functions defined on $\mathbb{R}$. Assume that for each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists a constant $C_x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) \leq C_x$ for all $f \in \mathcal{G}$. Prove that the function $h : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by:

$$h(x) = \sup \{f(x) \mid f \in \mathcal{G}\}, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}$$

is Borel measurable.

## Definitions and Theorems Used

Based on **Folland, G. B. (Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications)** and **De Barra, G. (Measure Theory and Integration)**:

1. **Borel Measurability of Continuous Functions:** Every continuous function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is Borel measurable.
    
    - _Intuition:_ Continuity is a very strong regularity condition; it ensures that the preimage of any open set is open, and open sets are the building blocks of Borel sets.
        
2. **Supremum of Measurable Functions:** If $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a **countable** sequence of measurable functions, then $h(x) = \sup_n f_n(x)$ is a measurable function.
    
    - _Intuition:_ For any value $\alpha$, the supremum is greater than $\alpha$ if and only if at least one function in the list is greater than $\alpha$.
        
3. **Density of Rational Numbers:** The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
    
    - _Intuition:_ Rational numbers are "everywhere"; any open interval, no matter how small, contains infinitely many rational points.
        
4. **Separability of the Real Line:** $\mathbb{R}$ contains a countable dense subset ($\mathbb{Q}$), which allows us to simplify uncountable topological problems into countable ones.

## Solution (Step-by-Step Explanation)

### Solution

**Step 1: Understand the challenge of uncountability.**

If $\mathcal{G}$ were a countable family, the result would follow immediately from the standard property that the supremum of a countable collection of measurable functions is measurable. However, $\mathcal{G}$ may be uncountable, so we must find a way to replace $\mathcal{G}$ with a countable subfamily that has the same supremum.

**Step 2: Utilize the property of continuity.**

By the **definition of the function $h$**, we know $h(x) = \sup_{f \in \mathcal{G}} f(x)$. For any fixed real number $\alpha$, we consider the set:

$$E_\alpha = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid h(x) > \alpha\}$$

By the **definition of supremum**, $h(x) > \alpha$ if and only if there exists some $f \in \mathcal{G}$ such that $f(x) > \alpha$. Thus, we can write:

$$E_\alpha = \bigcup_{f \in \mathcal{G}} \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid f(x) > \alpha\}$$

**Step 3: Analyze the components of the union.**

Because each $f \in \mathcal{G}$ is a **continuous function**, the set $U_f = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid f(x) > \alpha\}$ is the preimage of the open interval $(\alpha, \infty)$. By the **topological definition of continuity**, $U_f$ is an **open set** in $\mathbb{R}$.

**Step 4: Use the property of open sets in $\mathbb{R}$.**

The set $E_\alpha$ is a union of open sets $\{U_f\}_{f \in \mathcal{G}}$. In topology, any union (even an uncountable one) of open sets is itself an **open set**. Therefore, $E_\alpha$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}$.

**Step 5: Apply the definition of Borel sets.**

By the **definition of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra**, every open set in $\mathbb{R}$ is a Borel set. Since $E_\alpha$ is an open set for every $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, the preimage of any interval $(\alpha, \infty)$ under $h$ is a Borel set.

**Step 6: Conclude measurability.**

By the **generating set theorem for Borel measurability**, a function is Borel measurable if the preimage of every interval $(\alpha, \infty)$ is a Borel set. Since we have shown this is true for $h$, the function $h$ is Borel measurable.

**Final Conclusion:**

The function $h$ is Borel measurable.
